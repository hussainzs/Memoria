# Contributing to Memoria

Thanks for your interest in contributing! we’re excited you’re here.

## Project Status

Memoria is currently in **active MVP development**.
Over the next 2–3 weeks, the core architecture is being finalized (ideally). During this phase, we are **not yet accepting external pull requests**, but feedback and discussion are very welcome.

## How You Can Help Right Now
- Star the repository
- Read through the code and docs
- Open issues for:
  - Bugs
  - Design questions
  - Architectural suggestions
  - Feature ideas
- Join our discord community **[[Click Me](https://discord.gg/cSzVWf29bK)]**!

We’re especially interested in **thoughtful discussion**, not rushed PRs.

## Pull Requests
Once the MVP stabilizes, we’ll open the project up for contributions.
At that point, this file will be updated with:

- Branching strategy
- Code style guidelines
- Testing requirements
- PR review process

Please hold off on submitting PRs until then unless explicitly discussed with the maintainers.

## Communication

If you’re unsure whether something makes sense to propose:
- Open an issue first
- Start a discussion
- Ask questions

## Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to be respectful and constructive.
