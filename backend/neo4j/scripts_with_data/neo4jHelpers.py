⚠️ Default username: neo4j, password = ? If you set a different password make sure to update it here.
Also the connection URI should be default but if due to OS it's different, update it in env as well. You can check it in Neo4j desktop -> left tab -> local instances -> on the card for your connected instance it shows "Connection URI"
Default URI = neo4j://127.0.0.1:7687

⚠️ Neo4j Docs say connecting a driver is expensive and should be done once per application and reused. But make sure to close it.
