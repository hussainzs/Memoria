        "content": "Both Fred Miranda and Rangefinder Forum are excellent platforms for selling vintage cameras, including your Leica.\n\nIncluding the original lens and accessories can definitely increase the sale value of your Leica camera. Here's why:\n\n1. **Completeness**: A complete kit with the original lens and accessories is often more attractive to buyers than a body-only sale. It shows that you've taken care of the camera and have all the original parts.\n2. **Convenience**: Buyers appreciate not having to hunt down additional components, which can be time-consuming and costly. A complete kit makes it easier for them to start using the camera right away.\n3. **Authenticity**: Including the original lens and accessories can help prove the camera's authenticity and originality, which is important for collectors and enthusiasts.\n4. **Value**: A complete kit can command a higher price than a body-only sale. The additional value of the lens and accessories can add up quickly, making your camera more attractive to potential buyers.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\n1. **Condition**: Make sure the lens and accessories are in good condition and functional. If they're damaged or worn out, it might be better to sell them separately or not include them at all.\n2. **Originality**: Verify that the lens and accessories are indeed original to the camera. If they're not, be transparent about it in your listing to avoid any potential issues.\n3. **Pricing**: Research the market value of the camera, lens, and accessories separately to determine a fair price for the complete kit. You may need to adjust your pricing accordingly.\n\nWhen creating your listing, be sure to:\n\n1. **Include high-quality photos**: Show the camera, lens, and accessories from multiple angles, with clear views of any serial numbers, engravings, or other identifying features.\n2. **Provide detailed descriptions**: List the camera's condition, any flaws, and the included accessories. Mention any repairs, maintenance, or servicing done on the camera.\n3. **Set a competitive price**: Based on your research, set a price that's competitive with similar listings on the market.\n\nBy including the original lens and accessories, you can increase the appeal and value of your Leica camera.
