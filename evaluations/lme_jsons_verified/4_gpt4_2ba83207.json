Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Reusable Containers:**\n\n1. **Designate a container station**: Choose a specific area in your kitchen, like a cabinet or a shelf, to store all your reusable containers. This will help keep them centralized and easy to access.\n2. **Stack and nest**: Look for containers that can be stacked and nested together to save space. This will help prevent them from taking over your entire cabinet.\n3. **Use a container organizer**: Consider using a container organizer or a divider to separate your containers by size or type. This will make it easier to find the one you need.\n4. **Label and categorize**: Label each container with its contents or category (e.g., \"snacks,\" \"leftovers,\" \"takeout\") to help you quickly identify what's inside.\n5. **Clean and dry before storing**: Make sure to clean and dry your containers before storing them to prevent moisture buildup and bacterial growth.\n\n**Reusable Bags:**\n\n1. **Fold and store**: Fold your reusable bags to save space and store them in a compact area, like a drawer or a basket.\n2. **Use a bag holder**: Consider using a bag holder or a clip to keep your bags organized and easy to grab.\n3. **Categorize by type**: Store bags by type, such as produce bags, grocery bags, or lunch bags, to make them easy to find.\n4. **Keep them visible**: Store your reusable bags in a visible spot, like a hook or a basket near the entrance, to remind you to use them.\n5. **Clean and dry before storing**: Just like containers, make sure to clean and dry your reusable bags before storing them to prevent moisture buildup and bacterial growth.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Purge and declutter**: Regularly go through your containers and bags and remove any that are worn out, broken, or no longer needed.\n2. **Store out of direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade, so try to store your containers and bags in a shaded area.\n3. **Teach others**: If you live with others, make sure they know where the reusable containers and bags are stored and how to use them.\n4. **Make it a habit**: Try to make using reusable containers and bags a habit by keeping them easily accessible and incorporating them into your daily routine.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your reusable containers and bags organized, clutter-free, and ready for your next shopping trip or meal prep session!",

I'm glad to hear you're already using reusable containers from Thrive Market – that's a great step towards reducing waste.\n\nNow, let's dive into some tips on how to store your prepped meals to keep them fresh for a long time:\n\n**Cooling and Refrigeration:**\n\n1. **Cool meals quickly**: After cooking, cool your meals to room temperature within 2 hours to prevent bacterial growth.\n2. **Refrigerate promptly**: Refrigerate your cooled meals within 30 minutes of cooking. This will help prevent bacterial growth and keep your meals fresh.\n3. **Label and date containers**: Clearly label each container with the meal name, date, and any reheating instructions.\n\n**Container Tips:**\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Use airtight, leak-proof containers to prevent air from entering and spoiling your meals.\n2. **Portion control**: Divide your meals into individual portions to maintain freshness and prevent cross-contamination.\n3. **Container size**: Choose containers that fit the portion size you're preparing to minimize empty space and prevent moisture buildup.\n\n**Storage and Organization:**\n\n1. **Store in the correct zone**: Place containers in the coldest part of the refrigerator, usually the bottom shelf, to maintain a consistent temperature.\n2. **Organize by meal type**: Group similar meals together (e.g., all lunches or all dinners) to make it easy to grab-and-go.\n3. **Freezer storage**: If you're meal prepping for an extended period, consider freezing meals in airtight containers or freezer bags. Label and date them, and store in the freezer for up to 3-4 months.\n\n**Reheating and Safety:**\n\n1. **Reheat safely**: Reheat meals to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) to ensure food safety.\n2. **Use within 3-5 days**: Consume refrigerated meals within 3-5 days of cooking. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and discard the meal.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your meal preps fresh, safe, and ready to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nRemember to always check the specific storage instructions for the ingredients you're using, as some may have special requirements.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n* **Canned tomatoes instead of fresh:** Absolutely! Canned tomatoes are a great substitute for fresh tomatoes, especially in recipes like the Lentil Soup or the Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. They're often cheaper and have a longer shelf life. You can use crushed, diced, or whole canned tomatoes, depending on the recipe.\n* **Frozen vegetables:** If you can't find fresh bell peppers or Brussels sprouts at a good price, consider using frozen ones. They're just as nutritious and can be used in a pinch.\n* **Ground turkey or chicken instead of beef:** If you're looking to reduce the cost of ground beef, consider using ground turkey or chicken as a substitute. They're often cheaper and can be used in similar recipes.\n* **Shredded cheese instead of mozzarella:** If you already have shredded cheese at home, you can use it as a substitute for mozzarella in the Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. It might not melt as well, but it'll still be delicious.\n* **Omitting the balsamic glaze:** If you don't have balsamic glaze or don't want to spend money on it, you can omit it from the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and Roasted Vegetables recipe. The dish will still be flavorful with just the balsamic vinegar and honey.\n\nBy making these substitutions, you can reduce your total cost to around $60-$75, depending on the specific ingredients you choose. Keep in mind that you might need to adjust the recipes slightly to accommodate the substitutions.\n\nRemember, the key to reducing costs is to be flexible with your ingredients and recipes.
