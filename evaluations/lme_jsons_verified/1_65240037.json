        "content": "Tea tree oil is known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that may help to treat acne and other skin conditions. The proper application method is as follows:\n\n1. Dilute the tea tree oil: Tea tree oil should never be applied directly to the skin since it’s too strong and may cause irritation or redness. Mix a few drops of tea tree oil with a carrier oil such as coconut oil, jojoba oil or almond oil in a 1:10 ratio.\n\n2. Cleanse the skin: Before applying the tea tree oil, cleanse the skin with a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser. This will remove dirt and excess oil from the skin and make it easier for the tea tree oil to penetrate the pores.\n\n3. Apply the mixture: Dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into the diluted tea tree oil mixture and apply it directly onto the affected area. Gently massage it into the skin in circular motions.\n\n4. Leave it to dry: Allow the tea tree oil mixture to dry on the skin. Do not rinse it off immediately. Repeat this process twice a day.\n\nNote: Tea tree oil may cause skin irritation, particularly if it is not diluted. Conduct a patch test first by applying a small amount of diluted tea tree oil to your forearm or another part of your body. If you experience redness or itching, wash the area thoroughly and discontinue use.",
