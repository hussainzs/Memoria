You can always add a small message or joke in a subtle font or color.\n2. **Know your audience**: If you're confident your sister will appreciate a funny or sentimental message, go for it! If you're unsure, play it safe with a more neutral design.\n3. **Preview and refine**: Use Canva or Adobe Spark to create a design, and then preview it to see how it looks. Refine the design until you're happy with the result.\n\nSome ideas for special messages or inside jokes could be:\n\n* A favorite quote or song lyrics that resonate with her\n* A playful nickname or inside joke that's just between the two of you\n* A reference to a special memory or shared experience\n* A motivational or uplifting message to inspire her\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to come from a place of love and thoughtfulness.

Now that I have a better idea of what I'm looking for, I can take a closer look and see if I can find the perfect piece to go along with the phone case. Thanks for the advice!",

      "evidence": "The conversation history contains: [User 0] mentioning attending the Holiday Market 'a week before Black Friday', and [User 8] repeating the same about the market and discussing a phone case and jewelry. There is NO mention of buying an iPad anywhere in the provided text. No dates or events related to an iPad purchase are described.",
      "reasoning": "1. The question requires determining the time difference between two events: attending the Holiday Market and buying an iPad, specifically 'how many days before I bought my iPad'. 2. The Holiday Market is referenced twice with the temporal phrase 'a week before Black Friday', establishing its timing relative to Black Friday. 3. However, scanning the entire conversation history reveals zero references to purchasing, buying, or even owning an iPad—no dates, events, or mentions at all. 4. Without any information on when (or if) the iPad was bought, it is impossible to calculate the number of days between the market attendance and the iPad purchase. 5. The provided answer correctly identifies this lack of information, noting mentions of other items (like iPhone 13 Pro, possibly from broader context) but confirming no iPad reference, making it impossible to answer the temporal question.",
      "verified": true,
      "answer": "The information provided is not enough. You mentioned getting the iPhone 13 Pro and attending the market, but you did not mention buying an iPad.",
