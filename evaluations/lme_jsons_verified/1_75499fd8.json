While dog walkers can provide exercise and companionship, administering medication might not be a standard service they offer. However, it's definitely worth asking!\n\nSome dog walkers might be willing to administer flea and tick prevention medication as an additional service, especially if they have experience with dog care or have worked with dogs with similar needs. Others might not feel comfortable or be trained to do so.\n\nHere are a few factors to consider when asking a dog walker about medication administration:\n\n1. **Experience:** Does the dog walker have experience with administering medication to dogs? Have they worked with dogs that require regular medication?\n2. **Certifications:** Are they certified in pet first aid or CPR? While not directly related to medication administration, these certifications demonstrate a level of expertise in dog care.\n3. **Comfort level:** Is the dog walker comfortable administering medication, and are they willing to take on this responsibility?\n4. **Liability:** Who would be liable in case of an adverse reaction or incorrect administration of medication?\n\nIf you find a dog walker who is willing to administer Max's flea and tick prevention medication, make sure to:\n\n1. **Provide clear instructions:** Leave detailed instructions on the medication, including dosage, frequency, and any potential side effects.\n2. **Leave a schedule:** Create a schedule or calendar to ensure the walker knows when to apply the medication.\n3. **Monitor and follow up:** Regularly check in with the walker to confirm the medication has been administered correctly and on schedule.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider other options for medication administration, such as:\n\n1. **Hiring a pet sitter:** Pet sitters often provide more comprehensive care, including medication administration, feeding, and overnight stays.\n2. **Asking a trusted neighbor or friend:** If you have a trusted neighbor or friend who is familiar with Max, you could ask them to help with medication administration.\n3. **Automated medication dispensers:** There are automated medication dispensers available that can be programmed to dispense medication at set times.\n\nRemember to always prioritize Max's health and safety, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from your veterinarian if you're unsure about medication administration.",

The combination of the Kong's hollow center and the creamy peanut butter will provide a delightful challenge for Max to figure out how to get the treats out.\n\nHere are some additional tips to make the most out of the Kong Toy:\n\n1. **Start with a small amount:** Begin with a small amount of peanut butter or treats in the Kong to make it easy for Max to get them out. Gradually increase the amount as he becomes more comfortable with the toy.\n2. **Mix it up:** Vary the types of treats you use to stuff the Kong. You can try using different flavors of peanut butter, cream cheese, or even canned dog food.\n3. **Freeze it:** Freeze the Kong with the peanut butter or treats inside. This will make it more challenging for Max to get them out and provide a fun, cooling treat on a hot day.\n4. **Add a twist:** Try adding a twist to the Kong by stuffing it with a few kibbles or small treats, followed by a layer of peanut butter. This will make it more challenging for Max to get to the treats.\n5. **Supervise:** Always supervise Max when introducing a new toy, especially one with small parts like the Kong. Make sure he's not trying to chew on the Kong itself or ingest any small pieces.\n6. **Rotate toys:** Rotate the Kong Toy with other interactive toys to keep Max engaged and prevent boredom.\n\nRemember, the Kong Toy is not only a great way to keep Max entertained but also helps to reduce anxiety, stress, and destructive behavior caused by boredom.\n\nI hope Max enjoys his new Kong Toy, and you enjoy watching him have fun!",
