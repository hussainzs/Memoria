I'm glad to hear you did visit Germany last summer and have fond memories of your trip.\n\nNow, let's talk about Munich and Oktoberfest! Late September is a great time to visit Munich, and you'll have the opportunity to experience the world-famous Oktoberfest, which usually takes place from mid-September to early October.\n\nThe Oktoberfest grounds, also known as the Theresienwiese, are a massive open space in Munich where the festival is held. It's a must-visit attraction, even if you're not a big beer fan. The atmosphere is electric, with traditional German music, delicious food, and plenty of beer tents (Festhallen) operated by local breweries.\n\nIf you can, I highly recommend trying to catch Oktoberfest during your stay in Munich. It's an unforgettable experience, and you can soak up the festive atmosphere even if you're not a big drinker. Just be prepared for large crowds and long lines, especially on weekends.\n\nHere are some tips to help you make the most of your Oktoberfest experience:\n\n1. **Get there early**: Try to arrive at the festival grounds before 10 am to secure a spot in one of the beer tents. Popular tents like Hofbräu and Augustiner-Keller can fill up quickly.\n2. **Dress code**: Wear comfortable shoes and traditional German attire (Dirndl or Lederhosen) if you have it. It adds to the festive atmosphere and might even get you special treatment at the beer tents!\n3. **Beer tent strategy**: Research the different beer tents and their unique offerings. Some are more lively, while others offer a more laid-back atmosphere. Consider visiting a less crowded tent like Schottenhamel or Bräurosl.\n4. **Food and drinks**: Try traditional German dishes like Bratwurst, Schnitzel, and Apple Strudel. Don't forget to wash it down with a cold beer (or two, or three...).\n5. **Safety first**: Be aware of your surroundings, keep an eye on your belongings, and drink responsibly.\n\nIf you're not interested in Oktoberfest or want to explore other aspects of Munich, there are plenty of other attractions to discover:\n\n* **Marienplatz**: The heart of Munich's old town, featuring the iconic Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall) and its famous Glockenspiel.\n* **Viktualienmarkt**: A bustling outdoor market offering fresh produce, flowers, and souvenirs.\n* **English Garden**: A beautiful park larger than Central Park in New York City, perfect for a relaxing stroll or picnic.\n* **Nymphenburg Palace**: A stunning Baroque palace with beautiful gardens and a lovely lake.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
