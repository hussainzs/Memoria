However, the limited ports might be a concern, especially if you need to connect multiple devices simultaneously.\n\n**Portability vs. Ports: A Trade-Off**\n\nWhile the XPS 13's compact design is a major advantage, you're right to consider a laptop with more ports if you need them frequently. Here are some points to weigh:\n\n**Pros of a laptop with more ports:**\n\n1. **Convenience**: Having more ports means you can connect your devices without needing adapters or hubs, which can be a hassle.\n2. **Productivity**: If you're working on video editing projects, you might need to connect multiple devices, such as an external hard drive, monitor, and keyboard. More ports can help you stay organized and focused.\n\n**Cons of a laptop with more ports:**\n\n1. **Size and Weight**: Laptops with more ports tend to be larger and heavier, which might negate the portability advantage of the XPS 13.\n2. **Design Compromises**: Adding more ports can affect the laptop's design, potentially making it less sleek and premium.\n\n**Laptops with more ports to consider:**\n\n1. **Dell XPS 15**: The larger sibling of the XPS 13, the XPS 15 offers more ports, including an HDMI port, SD card slot, and USB-A ports, while still maintaining a relatively slim design.\n2. **HP Envy 15**: A more affordable option with a larger 15.6-inch display and a more extensive port selection, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card slot.\n3. **Lenovo ThinkPad P53**: A more powerful laptop designed for content creators, with a range of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card slot, as well as a larger 15.6-inch display.\n\n**Ultimate Decision**\n\nIf video editing is your primary use case, and you need more ports to stay productive, consider a laptop with a better port selection. However, if you're willing to adapt to using adapters or hubs, and portability is a top priority, the XPS 13 might still be a great choice.\n\nYou could also consider a compromise: look for laptops with a mix of USB-C and USB-A ports, which can provide more flexibility without sacrificing too much portability.\n\nWhich way are you leaning?",
