By going directly to the source, you can work with the designer to create a custom piece that reflects your personal style and the style of your partner. Plus, buying directly from the designer often means that you'll be able to get a better price and a higher quality ring.\n\nOne of the benefits of buying a ring directly from the designer is that you'll have the opportunity to work closely with them to create a custom piece. This allows you to incorporate your own personal style and preferences into the design of the ring. For example, if you love antique or vintage-inspired jewelry, you can work with the designer to create a ring that incorporates these elements. Or, if you and your partner both love nature, you could choose a ring with a natural or organic design.\n\nWhen it comes to finding a designer to work with, there are many talented individuals who create beautiful, unique engagement rings. Here are a few examples of designers who are worth considering:\n\n1.

She has a passion for working with unusual gemstones and creates rings that are both modern and timeless.\n2. Rachel Boston (@rachelbostonjewellery): Rachel is a London-based jewelry designer who creates beautiful, handcrafted engagement rings. She uses a combination of precious metals and diamonds to create rings that are both elegant and unique.

Lauren Hunt (@laurenhuntjewellery): Lauren is a New York-based jewelry designer who creates modern, geometric engagement rings. She uses a combination of diamonds, gold, and other precious materials to create rings that are both sophisticated and edgy.
