This is essentially free money that can help you reach your goal faster.\n2. **Avoid lifestyle inflation:** As your income increases, avoid the temptation to inflate your lifestyle by spending more on luxuries. Instead, direct excess funds towards your retirement savings.\n3. **Stay disciplined and patient:** Saving for retirement requires discipline and patience. Stay committed to your plan, and you'll be on track to achieving your goal.\n\nBy following this plan, you'll be well on your way to achieving your retirement goal.
