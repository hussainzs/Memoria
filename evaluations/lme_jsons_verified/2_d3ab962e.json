The South Rim of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and Four Corners are all incredible destinations, and visiting them in that order makes sense geographically.

You'll learn the basics, improve your skills, and build confidence in a supportive environment.\n\t+ Typically, these leagues have more emphasis on instruction and skill development, which can be beneficial if you're rusty or new to the sport.\n* Cons:\n\t+ You might find the games to be less competitive, which could be a drawback if you're looking for a challenge.\n\t+ You might be paired with players of varying skill levels, which could affect the overall team dynamic.\n\n**Recreational League (Focused on Fun):**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ These leagues often prioritize socializing and having fun over intense competition, which can be a great way to meet new people and enjoy the game in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\t+ You'll likely play with a mix of skill levels, but the focus is on enjoyment rather than winning at all costs.\n* Cons:\n\t+ You might not receive as much instruction or coaching, so you might not improve your skills as quickly.\n\t+ Some players might not take the games as seriously, which could lead to a lack of organization or inconsistent play.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. Are you looking to improve your skills and learn new techniques, or do you just want to have fun and socialize?\n2. Are you comfortable with a more competitive atmosphere, or do you prefer a more relaxed environment?\n3. How important is winning to you?

Williams has more budget-friendly options, while Flagstaff has a wider range of prices.\n\nUltimately, both Williams and Flagstaff are great choices, and you can't go wrong with either one. If you want to be closer to the Grand Canyon and don't mind a smaller town, Williams might be the way to go. If you prefer a bigger town with more amenities and don't mind a slightly longer drive to the park, Flagstaff could be the better fit.\n\nWhichever you choose, make sure to book your accommodations well in advance, especially during peak season (January is a popular time to visit the Grand Canyon!).\n\nKeep me posted on your road trip planning, and I'll be happy to help with any more questions or recommendations!",

      "evidence": "In session answer_5237bb0b_2: 'just did a 3-mile loop trail at Valley of Fire State Park last weekend.' In session answer_5237bb0b_1: 'I just got back from an amazing 5-mile hike at Red Rock Canyon two weekends ago'.",
      "reasoning": "1. Identify the two hikes mentioned: one is a '3-mile loop trail' described as 'last weekend' in the first session, and the other is a '5-mile hike' described as 'two weekends ago' in the second session. 2. The time references 'last weekend' and 'two weekends ago' indicate two consecutive weekends relative to the time of the messages (two weekends ago followed by last weekend). 3. Add the distances: 3 miles + 5 miles = 8 miles total. 4. This directly matches the question about the total distance of hikes on two consecutive weekends.",
