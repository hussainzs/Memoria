These are easy to prep, reheat, and can be customized with different ingredients.\n\n**Tip 5: Portion Control**\nPortion out individual meals in containers to make grab-and-go easy. Use glass or BPA-free containers to store your meals and label them with the date and contents.\n\n**Tip 6: Label and Organize**\nLabel and organize your prepped meals in your fridge or freezer.
