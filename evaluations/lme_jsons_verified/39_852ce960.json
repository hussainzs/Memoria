Gathering information: The first step is to gather all necessary information about the news story. This includes researching the subject matter, reviewing relevant documents, and conducting interviews.\n\n2. Verifying sources: The next step is to verify the sources of information used in the story. This includes checking the credentials of any experts or witnesses and ensuring that information obtained from social media or other online sources is reliable.\n\n3. Cross-checking information: Once sources have been verified, the information should be cross-checked with other sources to ensure accuracy. This involves comparing accounts from multiple sources and looking for inconsistencies or discrepancies.\n\n4. Fact-checking claims: It is essential to verify any claims made in the story. This includes fact-checking statistics, quotes, and other specific pieces of information.\n\n5. Reviewing chronology: A news story's chronology should be scrutinized to ensure that the events are reported in the correct order and are accurately depicted.\n\n6. Reviewing context: It is essential to review any context that may be relevant to the story. This includes examining the historical background, related events, and other factors that may be pertinent to the story's accuracy and relevance.\n\n7. Revising the story: Once all checks have been made, the story should be revised to reflect any changes made as a result of fact-checking or additional information gathered.\n\n8. Final review: The final step involves reviewing the story once more to ensure that all information presented is accurate and does not contain any errors or misinformation.\n\nAt the Associated Press, this process involves teams of editors, reporters, and fact-checkers working collaboratively to ensure the highest standards of accuracy and reporting."

Fact-checking a story can be done quickly, but at times it may require more time depending on the nature of the story.

Establishing a consistent wake-up time and morning routine can be challenging, but with a few strategies, you can train your body to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. Here are some tips to help you achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Set a consistent wake-up time**: Set your alarm for the same time every day, including weekends. Consistency will help regulate your body's internal clock.\n2. **Gradually adjust your wake-up time**: If you're not a morning person, don't try to wake up at 5 am immediately. Start by setting your alarm 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually work your way up to your desired wake-up time.\n3. **Create a wake-up routine**: Develop a consistent morning routine that signals your body that it's time to wake up and start the day. This can be as simple as:\n\t* Stretching or doing some light exercise\n\t* Drinking a glass of water or having a cup of coffee/tea\n\t* Meditating or practicing deep breathing exercises\n\t* Reading the news, a motivational quote, or a daily devotional\n4. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, making it easier to wake up. Open your curtains or take a short walk outside in the morning.\n5. **Avoid screens in the morning**: Try to avoid checking your phone or computer for at least 30 minutes after waking up. The blue light from screens can suppress melatonin production and make it harder to wake up in the morning.\n6. **Use a wake-up light**: A wake-up light is a device that simulates a sunrise by gradually increasing the light in your room, helping you wake up more naturally.\n7. **Make a plan for the morning**: Give yourself a reason to get out of bed by setting a goal or planning something enjoyable for the morning, such as exercise, breakfast with a friend, or a hobby.\n8. **Use positive self-talk**: Replace \"I don't want to get up\" with \"I'm excited to start the day\" or \"I'm looking forward to [insert morning activity].\"\n9. **Get enough sleep**: Ensure you're getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help you feel rested and energized in the morning.\n10. **Be patient**: It can take some time for your body to adjust to a new wake-up time and morning routine. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.\n\nIt's great to hear that reading a book before bed has helped you relax and reduce screen time! Keep up the good habit, and consider adding a relaxing activity to your morning routine to help you start the day feeling calm and focused.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Stick to your routine even on weekends or days off, and your body will eventually adjust to the new wake-up time and morning routine."

One thing I'm struggling with is finding a balance between having a consistent wake-up time and allowing myself some flexibility on the weekends.

        "content": "Finding a balance between consistency and flexibility is a common challenge. Here are some tips to help you strike a balance between having a consistent wake-up time and allowing yourself some flexibility on the weekends:\n\n1. **Set a \"sleep-in\" limit**: Decide on a reasonable sleep-in time for weekends, e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour later than your usual wake-up time. This allows you to still feel like you're getting a break, but not disrupting your routine too much.\n2. **Use a \"flexible anchor\"**: Choose a consistent wake-up time for weekdays and then allow yourself to sleep in a bit later on weekends. For example, if you wake up at 6:30 am on weekdays, you could aim for 7:30 am or 8:00 am on weekends.\n3. **Prioritize consistency on weekdays**: Focus on maintaining a consistent wake-up time during the week, when you have work or school commitments. This will help you establish a strong routine and make it easier to wake up at the same time every day.\n4. **Make weekends a \"relaxation\" time**: Instead of sleeping in late, use weekends as an opportunity to relax and recharge. You can still wake up at a reasonable hour and enjoy a leisurely morning, or use the extra time to pursue hobbies or activities you enjoy.\n5. **Use a \"sleep schedule\"**: Create a schedule that outlines your wake-up times for each day of the week. This can help you visualize your routine and make adjustments as needed. For example:\n\n| Day | Wake-up Time |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mon-Fri | 6:30 am |\n| Sat | 7:30 am |\n| Sun | 8:00 am |\n\n6. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body's needs. If you're feeling exhausted, it's okay to sleep in a bit later on the weekends. However, try to avoid sleeping in too late, as this can disrupt your routine and make it harder to wake up on Monday morning.\n7. **Gradually adjust**: If you're used to sleeping in late on weekends, don't try to switch to an early wake-up time immediately. Gradually adjust your wake-up time over a few weeks to give your body time to adjust.\n\nRemember, finding the perfect balance between consistency and flexibility is a personal process. Experiment with different approaches to find what works best for you and your lifestyle."

Here are some tips to help you stay motivated and avoid hitting the snooze button:\n\n1. **Place your alarm clock far away**: Put your alarm clock across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. This will make it harder to hit the snooze button and roll over.\n2. **Use a smart alarm**: Consider using a smart alarm that can monitor your sleep patterns and wake you up during a light sleep phase. This can help you feel more refreshed and alert in the morning.\n3. **Create a wake-up routine**: Develop a consistent morning routine that you enjoy, such as reading, stretching, or meditating. This will give you something to look forward to and make it easier to get out of bed.\n4. **Get some accountability**: Share your wake-up time with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can provide an added motivation to get out of bed.\n5. **Use a motivational mantra**: Create a personal mantra to repeat to yourself when you wake up, such as \"Today is a new day\" or \"I've got this!\" This can help boost your motivation and energy.\n6. **Expose yourself to sunlight**: Open your curtains or take a short walk outside in the morning to get some natural sunlight. This can help regulate your circadian rhythms and increase your energy levels.\n7. **Use a \"no snooze\" rule**: Make a rule for yourself that you're not allowed to hit the snooze button. This can help you build discipline and develop a consistent wake-up routine.\n8. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself after a successful morning, such as a favorite breakfast or a short break from work. This can provide an added motivation to get out of bed.\n9. **Make mornings enjoyable**: Play uplifting music, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, or read something inspiring to start your day on a positive note.\n10. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have off days. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or hit the snooze button. Instead, focus on getting back on track and moving forward.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop a consistent wake-up routine. Be patient, and don't give up!\n\nWhat do you think?

In a seller's market, the seller may be less willing to compromise.\n3. **Original offer and negotiations**: If you've already negotiated the price down or have a strong offer, the seller may be more open to covering some closing costs.\n4. **Seller's motivation**: If the seller is motivated to sell quickly, they may be more willing to cover closing costs to finalize the deal.\n\nHere are some possible scenarios based on the inspection report:\n\n**Minor issues or no major concerns**:\n\n* You may be able to negotiate 0.5% to 1% of the purchase price (around $1,625 to $3,250) to cover some or all of the closing costs.\n\n**Moderate issues or needed repairs**:\n\n* You may be able to negotiate 1% to 2% of the purchase price (around $3,250 to $6,500) to cover some or all of the closing costs, depending on the cost of the repairs.\n\n**Major issues or significant repairs**:\n\n* You may be able to negotiate 2% to 3% of the purchase price (around $6,500 to $9,750) or more to cover some or all of the closing costs, depending on the severity of the issues.\n\n**Requesting credits vs. repairs**:\n\n* Instead of asking the seller to fix the issues, you can request a credit at closing to cover the cost of the repairs. This can be a more appealing option for the seller, as it avoids the hassle of coordinating repairs.\n\nWhen negotiating with the seller, be sure to:\n\n1. **Highlight the inspection report findings**: Emphasize the specific issues and estimated repair costs to demonstrate the impact on the property's value.\n2. **Provide evidence**: Share quotes or estimates from contractors to support your claims.\n3. **Be reasonable**: Don't overreach; be prepared to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n4. **Put it in writing**: Ensure any agreements or credits are included in the contract or an addendum to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, negotiation is a give-and-take process.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Inspection report findings**: The minor issues with the roof and plumbing do warrant some consideration. While they're not major concerns, they do require attention and will likely need to be addressed in the near future.\n2. **Initial credit already agreed upon**: The seller has already agreed to provide a $2,000 credit towards closing costs, which shows they're willing to work with you. Building on that, asking for an additional 1% of the purchase price is a reasonable escalation.\n3. **Local market conditions**: If you're in a buyer's market or a relatively balanced market, you may have more leverage to negotiate. Even in a seller's market, the seller may be willing to compromise to finalize the deal.\n\nTo make your request more effective, consider the following:\n\n1. **Emphasize the cumulative effect**: Highlight the total amount of credits you're requesting ($2,000 + $3,250 = $5,250) and how it will benefit both parties by facilitating a smoother closing process.\n2. **Be flexible**: Be open to negotiating the amount or finding alternative solutions, such as the seller paying for specific repairs or providing a home warranty.\n3. **Show your commitment**: Reiterate your enthusiasm for the property and your commitment to moving forward with the purchase, provided the seller is willing to work with you on the closing costs.\n\nHere's an example script to help you make your request:\n\n\"Hi [Seller's Agent], I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the inspection report. As you know, we did identify some minor issues with the roof and plumbing. While they're not major concerns, we do believe they warrant some consideration. Given our initial agreement on the $2,000 credit towards closing costs, I was wondering if the seller would be willing to consider an additional 1% of the purchase price ($3,250) to help cover the remaining closing costs. This would bring the total credit to $5,250 and would greatly help us in finalizing the deal. We're still very interested in the property and believe this is a reasonable request considering the inspection report findings. Let me know if this is something the seller would be open to discussing.\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, professional, and respectful during the negotiation process. Good luck!",

Here are some specific examples of how to incorporate satire and irony into your comedy sketches on TikTok:\n\n**Satire:**\n\n1. **Exaggerate a trend:** Take a popular trend or cultural phenomenon and exaggerate it to absurdity. For example, create a sketch about a person who's obsessed with taking selfies, to the point where they're taking selfies in ridiculous situations, like during a job interview or while driving.\n2. **Mock serious issues:** Use satire to tackle serious issues like politics, social justice, or environmental concerns, but do it in a way that's humorous and ironic. For example, create a sketch about a politician who's trying to solve a major crisis, but keeps getting distracted by their phone notifications.\n3. **Poke fun at stereotypes:** Satire can be used to poke fun at stereotypes and societal expectations. For example, create a sketch about a person who's trying to fit into a certain group or demographic, but ends up being ridiculous and over-the-top in their attempts.\n\n**Irony:**\n\n1. **Use opposite expectations:** Set up a situation where the audience expects one thing to happen, but the opposite occurs. For example, create a sketch about a person who's trying to be healthy, but ends up eating an entire pizza by themselves.\n2. **Contrast between appearance and reality:** Use irony to highlight the contrast between how something appears and what's actually happening. For example, create a sketch about a person who looks like a tough, rugged outdoorsman, but is actually afraid of their own shadow.\n3. **Sarcastic commentary:** Use irony to make sarcastic commentary on everyday situations or cultural phenomena. For example, create a sketch about a person who's complaining about how hard their life is, but is actually living a life of luxury.\n\n**Examples of Satire and Irony in TikTok Sketches:**\n\n1. A sketch about a person who's trying to be eco-friendly, but ends up causing more harm to the environment than good. (Satire)\n2. A sketch about a person who's trying to be a social media influencer, but has only 10 followers and is still pretending to be a celebrity. (Irony)\n3. A sketch about a person who's trying to be a \"wellness guru,\" but is actually just eating Cheetos and playing video games all day. (Satire)\n4. A sketch about a person who's trying to be a \"thought leader,\" but is actually just regurgitating clichés and buzzwords. (Irony)\n5. A sketch about a person who's trying to be a \"minimalist,\" but has a cluttered and messy room. (Satire)\n\nRemember, the key to using satire and irony effectively is to be clever, witty, and unexpected. Don't be afraid to push the boundaries and be ridiculous – that's where the humor lies!"

        "content": "Certainly! Here are some tips for employees on how to approach their managers about their career goals:\n\n1. Be specific: Approach your manager with specific goals in mind, such as a desire to take on more responsibility, move into a different role or department, or develop new skills. By being specific and clear about what you would like to achieve, you can make it easier for your manager to offer relevant advice or support.\n\n2. Be prepared: Do your research on the career paths available in your organization, learn what qualifications and experience are required to move into different roles, and be ready to discuss how you plan to achieve your goals. Having a plan in place can help demonstrate to your manager that you are serious about your career advancement.\n\n3. Schedule a meeting: Rather than trying to bring up the topic of career goals in an informal context, such as during a hallway conversation, schedule a dedicated conversation with your manager. This allows you to discuss your goals in depth and gives your manager time to prepare thoughtful feedback or guidance.\n\n4. Seek feedback: Ask your manager for feedback on your job performance and where they see your strengths and potential areas for growth. This can help you identify areas for skill development or opportunities to take on more responsibility.\n\n5. Be open-minded: Be open to feedback and suggestions from your manager, and consider their perspective on your skills and goals. Your manager may have valuable insights and ideas that you haven't considered before.\n\nBy approaching your manager in a thoughtful and prepared manner, you can help make the conversation around career goals feel less intimidating and more productive. Remember that your manager's goals will also be to retain talent and ensure that you remain engaged and committed to your role, so they should be receptive to discussing your goals and offering support."

For the economics term, see Gross domestic product of region.\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679\nEuropean Union regulation\nText with EEA relevance\n\nTitle Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive)\nMade by European Parliament and Council of the European Union\nJournal reference L119, 4 May 2016, p. 1–88\nHistory\nDate made 14 April 2016\nImplementation date 25 May 2018\nPreparative texts\nCommission proposal COM/2012/010 final – 2012/0010 (COD)\nOther legislation\nReplaces Data Protection Directive\nCurrent legislation\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation on data protection and privacy in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.[1] Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals, formally called \"data subjects\", who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.\n\nThe GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.\n\nThe regulation became a model for many other laws across the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. As of 6 October 2022 the United Kingdom retains the law in identical form despite no longer being an EU member state. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.[2]\nContents\n1 Contents\n1.1 General provisions\n1.2 Risk-based approach\n1.3 Principles\n1.4 Rights of the data subject\n1.4.1 Transparency and modalities\n1.4.2 Information and access\n1.4.3 Rectification and erasure\n1.4.4 Right to object and automated decisions\n1.5 Controller and processor\n1.5.1 Pseudonymisation\n1.5.2 Records of processing activities\n1.5.3 Security of personal data\n1.5.4 Data protection officer\n1.6 Remedies, liability and penalties\n2 Exemptions\n3 Applicability outside of the European Union\n3.1 EU Representative\n3.2 Third countries\n3.3 United Kingdom implementation\n4 Reception\n5 Impact\n5.1 Enforcement and inconsistency\n5.2 Influence on foreign laws\n6 Timeline\n7 EU Digital Single Market\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 Citations\n11 External links\nContents\nThe GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions.[3]\n\nGeneral provisions\nThe regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects data from EU residents), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,[4] the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a \"purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity.\" (Recital 18)\n\nAccording to the European Commission, \"Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.\"[5] The precise definitions of terms such as \"personal data\", \"processing\", \"data subject\", \"controller\", and \"processor\" are stated in Article 4 of the Regulation.[6]\n\nThe regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether Article 48[6] of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. Article 48 states that any judgement of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state.[7] The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at State level, Union level, and international levels.[8]\n\nA single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its \"lead authority\", based on the location of its \"main establishment\" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a \"one-stop shop\" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU (Articles 46–55 of the GDPR).[9][10] A European Data Protection Board (EDPB) co-ordinates the SAs. EDPB thus replaces the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations (Articles 2(2)(a) and 88 of the GDPR).\n\nRisk-based approach\nThe first reform of the personal data protection EU legislation introduced the risk-based approach as a privileged enforcement method,[11] which shifts the duty to controllers for ensuring compliance.[12] The reason behind the adoption of this approach resides in the wish to move data protection “from theory to practice” and towards accountability.[13] The risk-based approach is envisioned as a type of meta-regulation that encourages controllers to go beyond their legal obligations. Its main goal is to make controllers their own enforcers, while also complementing the data protection framework and disapplying rules where they are unnecessary or not proportional.[12] The risk-based approach requires data controllers to evaluate at each stage of the data life cycle the risks of data processing in relation to individuals' rights and freedoms.[14] The data controllers will implement this approach through data protection impact assessments (Article 35 GDPR) and notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority (Article 33 GDPR), among other procedures.[15] The risk based approach under the GDPR should not be confused with the notion of risk regulation, which is a “governmental interference with market or social processes to control potential adverse consequences”[16] and refers to how enforcement agencies prioritize action.\n\nPrinciples\nPersonal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis to do so. Article 6 states the lawful purposes are:[17]\n\n(a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;\n(b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;\n(c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;\n(d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;\n(e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;\n(f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (especially in the case of children)[7]\nIf informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for (Article 7; defined in Article 4).[18][19] Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be \"bundled\" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely given. (Recital 32)\n\nData subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. (Article 7(3)) A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. (Article 8) Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old (Article 8(1)), must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable (Article 8).[20][21]\n\nIf consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).[22][23]\n\nRights of the data subject\nTransparency and modalities\nArticle 12 requires that the data controller provides information to the \"data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.\"[7]\n\nInformation and access\nThe right of access (Article 15) is a data subject right.[24] It gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data (Article 15(3)); furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes of the processing (Article 15(1)(a)), with whom the data is shared (Article 15(1)(c)), and how it acquired the data (Article 15(1)(g)).\n\nA data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.[25] In practice, however, providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's Siri, where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier that the manufacturer restricts access to,[26] or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on device fingerprints that can be challenging to capture, send, and verify.[27]\n\nBoth data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to data portability is provided by Article 20 of the GDPR.[28]\n\nRectification and erasure\nA right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right of erasure in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.[29][30] Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds within 30 days, including noncompliance with Article 6(1) (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data (see also Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González).[7]\n\nRight to object and automated decisions\nArticle 21 of the GDPR allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing or non-service related purposes.[31] This means the data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data.\n\nThere are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example, if:\n\nLegal or official authority is being carried out\n\"Legitimate interest\", where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the data subject with a service they signed up for\nA task being carried out for public interest.\nGDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication the controller has with them. This should be clear and separate from any other information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of their data.\n\nThere are instances the controller can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objection request is \"manifestly unfounded\" or \"excessive\", so each case of objection must be looked at individually.[31] Other countries such as Canada [32] are also, following the GDPR, considering legislation to regulate automated decision making under privacy laws, even though there are policy questions as to whether this is the best way to regulate AI.[citation needed]\n\nController and processor\nData controllers must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, as well as the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a data protection officer (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report data breaches to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.\n\nTo be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. Article 25 requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymising personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).[7] When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly informed about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely algorithmic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR, including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed, their right to obtain a portable copy of the stored data, their right to erasure of their data under certain circumstances, their right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely algorithmic basis, and their right to file complaints with a Data Protection Authority. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.[33][34]\n\nData protection impact assessments (Article 35) have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.\n\nArticle 25 requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.\n\nA report[35] by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.\n\nPseudonymisation\nAccording to the GDPR, pseudonymisation is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete data anonymisation).[36] An example is encryption, which renders the original data unintelligible in a process that cannot be reversed without access to the correct decryption key. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.\n\nAnother example of pseudonymisation is tokenisation, which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.\n\nPseudonymisation is a privacy-enhancing technology and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).[37]\n\nRecords of processing activities\nAccording to Article 30,[7] records of processing activities have to be maintained by each organisation matching one of following criteria:\n\nemploying more than 250 people;\nthe processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;\nthe processing is not occasional;\nprocessing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\nSuch requirements may be modified by each EU country. The records shall be in electronic form and the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.\n\nRecords of controller shall contain all of the following information:\n\nthe name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer;\nthe purposes of the processing;\na description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;\nthe categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;\nwhere applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\nwhere possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data\nwhere possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).\nRecords of processor shall contain all of the following information:\n\nthe name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;\nthe categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;\nwhere applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the\ndocumentation of suitable safeguards;\nwhere possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).[7]\nSecurity of personal data\nControllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation (consent, contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.\n\nArticle 33 states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined (Article 34). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach (Article 33). However, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption (Article 34).[7]\n\nData protection officer\nSee also: European Commission Data Protection Officer\nArticle 37 requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by a public authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences (Articles 9 and Article 10,[38]) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.[7]\n\nA designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.\n\nThe DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, data security (including dealing with cyberattacks) and other critical business continuity issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations. The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization.[39] More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.[40]\n\nOrganisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations (Article 27). This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO.[41]\n\nRemedies, liability and penalties\nSee also: GDPR fines and notices\nBesides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following Article 83 GDPR the following sanctions can be imposed:\n\na warning in writing in cases of first and non-intentional noncompliance\nregular periodic data protection audits\na fine up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions: (Article 83, Paragraph 4[42])\nthe obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, and 42 and 43\nthe obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43\nthe obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4)\na fine up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions: (Article 83, Paragraph 5 & 6[42])\nthe basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9\nthe data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22\nthe transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation pursuant to Articles 44 to 49\nany obligations pursuant to member state law adopted under Chapter IX\nnoncompliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1)[7]\nExemptions\nThese are some cases which are not addressed in the GDPR specifically, thus are treated as exemptions.[43]\n\nPersonal or household activities\nLaw enforcement\nNational security[7]\nWhen the GDPR was being created, it was strictly created for the regulation of personal data which goes into the hands of companies. What is not covered by the GDPR is non-commercial information or household activities.[44] An example of these household activities may be emails between two high school friends.\n\nConversely, an entity or more precisely an \"enterprise\" has to be engaged in \"economic activity\" to be covered by the GDPR.[a] Economic activity is defined broadly under European Union competition law.[45]\n\nApplicability outside of the European Union\nThe GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) if they are engaged in the \"offering of goods or services\" (regardless of whether a payment is required) to data subjects within the EEA, or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects within the EEA (Article 3(2)). The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place.[46] This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR extraterritorial jurisdiction for non-EU establishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU.[47]\n\nEU Representative\nUnder Article 27, non-EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee within the European Union, an \"EU Representative\", to serve as a point of contact for their obligations under the regulation. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensure compliance with this GDPR. A natural (individual) or moral (corporation) person can play the role of an EU Representative.[48] The non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document (letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. The said designation can only be given in writing.[49]\n\nAn establishment's failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of the regulation and relevant obligations, which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. The intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of the infringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravating factors.[50]\n\nAn establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasional processing that does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing.[7] Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.[51]\n\nThird countries\nChapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countries outside of the EEA — known as third countries — unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the third country's data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the European Commission (Article 45).[52][53] Binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses for data protection issued by a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), or a scheme of binding and enforceable commitments by the data controller or processor situated in a third country, are among examples.[54]\n\nUnited Kingdom implementation\nExplanation of the possible results from UK's divergence from the European GDPR[55]\nThe applicability of GDPR in the United Kingdom is affected by Brexit. Although the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, it remained subject to EU law, including GDPR, until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.[52] The United Kingdom granted royal assent to the Data Protection Act 2018 on 23 May 2018, which augmented the GDPR, including aspects of the regulation that are to be determined by national law, and criminal offences for knowingly or recklessly obtaining, redistributing, or retaining personal data without the consent of the data controller.[56][57]\n\nUnder the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, existing and relevant EU law was transposed into local law upon completion of the transition, and the GDPR was amended by statutory instrument to remove certain provisions no longer needed due to the UK's non-membership in the EU. Thereafter, the regulation will be referred to as \"UK GDPR\".[58][53][52] The UK will not restrict the transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR. However, the UK will become a third country under the EU GDPR, meaning that personal data may not be transferred to the country unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the European Commission performs an adequacy decision on the suitability of British data protection legislation (Chapter V). As part of the withdrawal agreement, the European Commission committed to perform an adequacy assessment.[52][53]\n\nIn April 2019, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued a proposed code of practice for social networking services when used by minors, enforceable under GDPR, which also includes restrictions on \"like\" and \"streak\" mechanisms in order to discourage social media addiction and on the use of this data for processing interests.[59][60]\n\nIn March 2021, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden stated that the UK was exploring divergence from the EU GDPR in order to \"[focus] more on the outcomes that we want to have and less on the burdens of the rules imposed on individual businesses\".[61]\n\nReception\nAs per a study conducted by Deloitte in 2018, 92% of companies believe they are able to comply with GDPR in their business practices in the long run.[62]\n\nCompanies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices with GDPR. The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice. A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent to record calls. Additionally, when recording has commenced, should the caller withdraw their consent, then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording and ensure the recording does not get stored.[63]\n\nIT professionals expect that compliance with the GDPR will require additional investment overall: over 80 percent of those surveyed expected GDPR-related spending to be at least US$100,000.[64] The concerns were echoed in a report commissioned by the law firm Baker & McKenzie that found that \"around 70 percent of respondents believe that organizations will need to invest additional budget/effort to comply with the consent, data mapping and cross-border data transfer requirements under the GDPR.\"[65] The total cost for EU companies is estimated at around €200 billion while for US companies the estimate is for $41.7 billion.[66] It has been argued that smaller businesses and startup companies might not have the financial resources to adequately comply with the GDPR, unlike the larger international technology firms (such as Facebook and Google) that the regulation is ostensibly meant to target first and foremost.[67][68] A lack of knowledge and understanding of the regulations has also been a concern in the lead-up to its adoption.[69] A counter-argument to this has been that companies were made aware of these changes two years prior to them coming into effect and should have had enough time to prepare.[70]\n\nThe regulations, including whether an enterprise must have a data protection officer, have been criticized for potential administrative burden and unclear compliance requirements.[71] Although data minimisation is a requirement, with pseudonymisation being one of the possible means, the regulation provide no guidance on how or what constitutes an effective data de-identification scheme, with a grey area on what would be considered as inadequate pseudonymisation subject to Section 5 enforcement actions.[72][73][74] There is also concern regarding the implementation of the GDPR in blockchain systems, as the transparent and fixed record of blockchain transactions contradicts the very nature of the GDPR.[75] Many media outlets have commented on the introduction of a \"right to explanation\" of algorithmic decisions,[76][77] but legal scholars have since argued that the existence of such a right is highly unclear without judicial tests and is limited at best.[78][79]\n\nThe GDPR has garnered support from businesses who regard it as an opportunity to improve their data management.[80][81] Mark Zuckerberg has also called it a \"very positive for the Internet\",[82] and has called for GDPR-style laws to be adopted in the US.[83] Consumer rights groups such as The European Consumer Organisation are among the most vocal proponents of the legislation.[84] Other supporters have attributed its passage to the whistleblower Edward Snowden.[85] Free software advocate Richard Stallman has praised some aspects of the GDPR but called for additional safeguards to prevent technology companies from \"manufacturing consent\".[86]\n\nImpact\nAcademic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law \"is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime.\"\n\nDespite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously-obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). Phishing scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws.[87][22] In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.[88][89]\n\nThe deluge of GDPR-related notices also inspired memes, including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means (such as an Ouija board or Star Wars opening crawl), suggesting that Santa Claus's \"naughty or nice\" list was a violation, and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former BBC Radio 4 Shipping Forecast announcer. A blog, GDPR Hall of Shame, was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices, and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation's requirements. Its author remarked that the regulation \"has a lot of nitty gritty, in-the-weeds details, but not a lot of information about how to comply\", but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply, making some of its responses unjustified.[90][91][92][93][94]\n\nResearch indicates that approximately 25% of software vulnerabilities have GDPR implications.[95] Since Article 33 emphasizes breaches, not bugs, security experts advise companies to invest in processes and capabilities to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes.[96][97] An investigation of Android apps' privacy policies, data access capabilities, and data access behaviour has shown that numerous apps display a somewhat privacy-friendlier behaviour since the GDPR was implemented, although they still retain most of their data access privileges in their code.[98][99] An investigation of the Consumer Council of Norway (called Forbrukerrådet in Norwegian) into the post-GDPR data subject dashboards on social media platforms (such as Google dashboard) has concluded that large social media firms deploy deceptive tactics in order to discourage their customers from sharpening their privacy settings.[100]\n\nOn the effective date, some websites began to block visitors from EU countries entirely (including Instapaper,[101] Unroll.me,[102] and Tribune Publishing-owned newspapers, such as the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times) or redirect them to stripped-down versions of their services (in the case of National Public Radio and USA Today) with limited functionality and/or no advertising so that they will not be liable.[103][104][105][106] Some companies, such as Klout, and several online video games, ceased operations entirely to coincide with its implementation, citing the GDPR as a burden on their continued operations, especially due to the business model of the former.[107][108][109] The volume of online behavioural advertising placements in Europe fell 25–40% on 25 May 2018.[110][111]\n\nIn 2020, two years after the GDPR began its implementation, the European Commission assessed that users across the EU had increased their knowledge about their rights, stating that \"69% of the population above the age of 16 in the EU have heard about the GDPR and 71% of people heard about their national data protection authority.\"[112][113] The commission also found that privacy has become a competitive quality for companies which consumers are taking into account in their decisionmaking processes.[112]\n\nEnforcement and inconsistency\nMain article: GDPR fines and notices\nFacebook and subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Google LLC (targeting Android), were immediately sued by Max Schrems's non-profit NOYB just hours after midnight on 25 May 2018, for their use of \"forced consent\". Schrems asserts that both companies violated Article 7(4) by not presenting opt-ins for data processing consent on an individualized basis, and requiring users to consent to all data processing activities (including those not strictly necessary) or would be forbidden from using the services.[114][115][116][117][118] On 21 January 2019, Google was fined €50 million by the French DPA for showing insufficient control, consent, and transparency over use of personal data for behavioural advertising.[119][120] In November 2018, following a journalistic investigation into Liviu Dragnea, the Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) used a GDPR request to demand information on the RISE Project's sources.[121][122]\n\nIn July 2019, the British Information Commissioner's Office issued an intention to fine British Airways a record £183 million (1.5% of turnover) for poor security arrangements that enabled a 2018 web skimming attack affecting around 380,000 transactions.[123][124][125][126][127] British Airways was ultimately fined a reduced amount of £20m, with the ICO noting that they had \"considered both representations from BA and the economic impact of COVID-19 on their business before setting a final penalty\".[128]\n\nIn December 2019, Politico reported that Ireland and Luxembourg – two smaller EU countries that have had a reputation as a tax havens and (especially in the case of Ireland) as a base for European subsidiaries of U.S. big tech companies – were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR, with Ireland citing the complexity of the regulation as a factor. Critics interviewed by Politico also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states, the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities, and a lack of cooperation between member states.[129]\n\nWhile companies are now subject to legal obligations, there are still various inconsistencies in the practical and technical implementation of GDPR.[130] As an example, according to the GDPR's right to access, the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather about them. However, in a study on loyalty cards in Germany, companies did not provide the data subjects with the exact information of the purchased articles.[131] One might argue that such companies do not collect the information of the purchased articles, which does not conform with their business models. Therefore, data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation. As a result, studies have suggested for a better control through authorities.[131]\n\nAccording to the GDPR, end-users' consent should be valid, freely given, specific, informed and active.[132] However, the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the Big Tech, i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM), use dark patterns in their consent obtaining mechanisms, which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent.[132]\n\nIn March 2021, EU member states led by France were reported to be attempting to modify the impact of the privacy regulation in Europe by exempting national security agencies.[133]\n\nAfter around 160 million Euros in GDPR fines were imposed in 2020, the figure was already over one billion Euros in 2021.[134]\n\nInfluence on foreign laws\nMass adoption of these new privacy standards by multinational companies has been cited as an example of the \"Brussels effect\", a phenomenon wherein European laws and regulations are used as a baseline due to their gravitas.[135]\n\nThe U.S. state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act on 28 June 2018, taking effect on 1 January 2020; it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR. Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective, as a collection of state-level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance.[136][137][138] Two other U.S. states have since enacted similar legislation: Virginia passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act on 2 March 2021,[139] and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act on 8 July 2021.[140]\n\nThe Republic of Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership, has adopted the Law on The Protection of Personal Data on 24 March 2016 in compliance with the EU acquis.[141]\n\nIn China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), \"China's first comprehensive law designed to regulate online data and protect personal information\" came into force in 2021.[142]\n\nTimeline\n25 January 2012: The proposal for the GDPR was released.[10]\n21 October 2013: The European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) had its orientation vote.\n15 December 2015: Negotiations between the European Parliament, Council and Commission (Formal Trilogue meeting) resulted in a joint proposal.\n17 December 2015: The European Parliament's LIBE Committee voted for the negotiations between the three parties.\n8 April 2016: Adoption by the Council of the European Union.[143] The only member state voting against was Austria, which argued that the level of data protection in some respects falls short compared to the 1995 directive.[144][145]\n14 April 2016: Adoption by the European Parliament.[146]\n24 May 2016: The regulation entered into force, 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.[24]\n25 May 2018: Its provisions became directly applicable in all member states, two years after the regulations enter into force.[24]\n20 July 2018: the GDPR became valid in the EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway),[147] after the EEA Joint Committee and the three countries agreed to follow the regulation.[148]\nEU Digital Single Market\nThe EU Digital Single Market strategy relates to \"digital economy\" activities related to businesses and people in the EU.[149] As part of the strategy, the GDPR and the NIS Directive all apply from 25 May 2018. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation was also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018, but will be delayed for several months.[150] The eIDAS Regulation is also part of the strategy.\n\nIn an initial assessment, the European Council has stated that the GDPR should be considered \"a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives\".[151]\n\nSee also\nflag European Union portal\nicon Law portal\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)\nPersonal Information Protection Law (PIPL) (China)\nConvention on Cybercrime\nData Governance Act, proposed EU law from 2020\nData portability\nDigital Markets Act\nDigital Services Act\nDo Not Track legislation\nePrivacy Regulation\nEU��US Privacy Shield\nEuropean Data Protection Board (EDPB)\nGeneral Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD)\nPrivacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002\nPrivacy Impact Assessment\nProtection of Personal Information Act (PoPIA) (South Africa)\nNotes\n Refer GDPR article 4(18): 'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.[7]\nCitations\n \"Presidency of the Council: 'Compromise text.

        "content": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union (EU) regulation on data protection and privacy in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It is designed to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business. The GDPR applies to any enterprise that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA, regardless of its location or the data subjects' citizenship or residence. It came into force on May 25, 2018, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states. The GDPR has influenced data protection laws in other countries, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It applies to data controllers, processors, and data subjects located in the EU and, under certain circumstances, to organizations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. It sets out specific rights for individuals with regards to their personal data, including the right to access, rectify, erase, object to processing, and data portability. It also imposes obligations on data controllers and processors, including the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data and to appoint a data protection officer in certain cases. The GDPR provides for penalties for non-compliance, including fines of up to 4% of a company's global annual revenue or €20 million (whichever is greater)."

The choice ultimately depends on the tone and style of your lamp and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**Brass Finish:**\n\n* Brass is a warm, golden metal that can add a sense of luxury and sophistication to your space.\n* It can complement warm-toned lamps with a vintage flair, especially those with golden or bronze accents.\n* Brass can also create a nice contrast with cooler-toned lamps, adding a pop of warmth and depth to the space.\n* If your lamp has a more ornate or intricate design, brass can help to draw attention to the details.\n\n**Copper Finish:**\n\n* Copper is a warm, rich metal that can add a sense of warmth and coziness to your space.\n* It can complement lamps with a more rustic or distressed finish, creating a harmonious, earthy look.\n* Copper can also add a touch of industrial chic to your space, especially if your lamp has a more modern or minimalist design.\n* If your lamp has a bold, bright color, copper can help to tone down the overall look and create a more balanced atmosphere.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you make a decision:\n\n* What is the tone of your lamp? Is it warm, cool, or neutral?\n* What is the style of your lamp? Is it ornate, minimalist, or somewhere in between?\n* What is the overall aesthetic you want to achieve in your living room? Do you want it to feel luxurious, cozy, or modern?\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could also consider the following:\n\n* Look at pictures of your lamp online or in a catalog to get a sense of how it would look with a brass or copper finish.\n* Read reviews or ask for recommendations from friends who have a similar lamp or style.\n* Consider ordering a small, inexpensive metal item with a brass or copper finish to test the look before committing to a larger tray.\n\nUltimately, trust your instincts and choose the finish that resonates with your personal style and the aesthetic you want to create in your living room."

        "content": "A tray with a diameter of 12-15 inches can be a great size for a coffee table, depending on the overall scale and layout of your table and the items you plan to display. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Pros of a 12-15 inch tray:**\n\n* This size tray can hold a decent amount of items, such as a few books, a vase, and some decorative objects, without overwhelming the coffee table.\n* It's large enough to create a visually appealing vignette, but small enough to leave some negative space around it.\n* This size tray can be easily moved or rearranged on the coffee table to accommodate different gatherings or activities.\n\n**Cons of a 12-15 inch tray:**\n\n* If your coffee table is particularly small, a tray of this size might overwhelm the surface or leave little room for other items.\n* If you plan to display larger items, such as a large vase or a decorative centerpiece, a smaller tray might not provide enough space.\n* A larger tray might be more suitable if you want to create a bold, statement piece on your coffee table.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n* **Smaller tray (8-10 inches):** A smaller tray can be ideal for a compact coffee table or if you want to create a more intimate, cozy atmosphere. It's also a great option if you only need to corral a few small items.\n* **Larger tray (18-20 inches):** A larger tray can make a bigger statement on your coffee table and provide more space for displaying larger items or creating a dramatic vignette.\n\nUltimately, the ideal tray size depends on your personal style, the scale of your coffee table, and the items you plan to display. If you're still unsure, consider the following:\n\n* Measure your coffee table and the items you want to display to get a sense of the ideal tray size.\n* Look at pictures of coffee tables with trays online or in decorating magazines to get inspiration and gauge the proportion of the tray to the table.\n* Consider starting with a smaller tray and adding more items or upgrading to a larger tray as needed.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision!"

The Fresh Earth Token (FET) is a verifiable science and technology-based token that measures the impact of regenerative practices using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, reduction in chemical use, and increase in food quality. The token is unique to each country and represents fractional ownership of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business, allowing investors to participate in the growth and success of the ecosystem and share in the value generated.\n\nThe ecosystem also includes an expert community, which is an autonomous decentralised and transparent community-governed ecosystem with open sourced and independently verifiable measures of impact. It enables, improves and facilitates local collaborations to optimize each stakeholder in the supply chain and hence the overall system.\n\nThe retail marketplace is a four-sided ecommerce platform that connects Consumers with Farmers, Designers (programs) and Manufacturers (products) with supply chain (Packers, Drivers, Physical Stores). It is centred around the four players and allows for the creation and management of storefronts, inventory management, buying and selling of products, produce and programs, and end to end supply chain processes.\n\nThe Consumer Movement, also known as the Consumer App, allows consumers to create their own food health and farming system by building the community and an accurate demand profile, participating in information that allows the self-organisation of the ecosystem. It is a gamified impact adventure whereby users and the community have the ability to reverse global warming by participating in challenges, milestones and activities.\n\nThe Fresh Earth Impact Validation (FEIV) is a score related to a global standard of measurement against four KPIs: Health, Economy, Food Quality, and Environment. The FEIV uses the Guardian Authentication platform to source regulated and validated internal and external data, pulling it into an open-source development sandbox, using a visualisation tech and approved methodology to measure, quantify and value the data sets.\n\nThe Fresh Earth Rewards (FER) system is designed to redistribute tokens and wealth among stakeholders based on their impact, participation and ecosystem development, as an alternative to investor funding.

The city's canals, architecture, and cultural influences are all reminiscent of Venice during its golden age.\n* **Florence:** The city's art, architecture, and cultural movements, such as the Renaissance humanism, are also reflected in Camorr.\n* **Medici Family:** The powerful and influential merchant families in Camorr, like the Bondsmagi, are inspired by the Medici family, who dominated Florentine politics and commerce during the Renaissance.\n\n**Other historical inspirations:**\n\n* **Ancient Greece and Rome:** Lynch drew inspiration from classical mythology, architecture, and culture to create the Elder Glass and the mysterious, ancient civilizations that shaped the world of the Gentlemen Bastards.\n* **Baroque and Rococo:** The ornate, elaborate, and theatrical styles of these art movements are reflected in the architecture, fashion, and art of Camorr.\n* **Piracy and Smuggling:** The Gentlemen Bastards' criminal exploits are inspired by the golden age of piracy and smuggling in the Mediterranean during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n* **Carnival and Masquerade:** The Carnival-like atmosphere and masquerade balls in the series are inspired by the Venetian Carnival and the lavish parties of the European aristocracy during the 18th century.\n\n**Fantastical elements:**\n\nWhile the series is heavily influenced by historical periods and cultures, Lynch also incorporated fantastical elements to create a unique and immersive world. These elements include:\n\n* **Magic:** The Bondsmagi, a powerful group of magic-users, wield powerful magic that is deeply rooted in the world's history and politics.\n* **Mythical creatures:** Fantastical creatures, like the mysterious, ancient beings known as the \"Elder Gods,\" and the eerie, ghostly \"Wraiths,\" add a layer of wonder and danger to the world.\n* **Fantastical architecture:** The city of Camorr is filled with fantastical buildings, bridges, and monuments that defy explanation, adding to the sense of wonder and magic in the series.\n\nBy combining historical inspirations with fantastical elements, Scott Lynch created a rich, immersive, and unique world that feels both familiar and strange.

Here are some tips that might help you stay organized and on top of your workload:\n\n**1. Set clear goals and objectives**: Start by setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for your campaign and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you focus on what needs to be done and prioritize your tasks accordingly.\n\n**2. Create a schedule and stick to it**: Plan out your day, week, and month in advance. Use a planner, calendar, or app to schedule tasks and allocate specific time slots for each activity. Set reminders and alerts to ensure you stay on track.\n\n**3. Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix**:\n\t* Urgent and important (Do first)\n\t* Important but not urgent (Schedule)\n\t* Urgent but not important (Delegate)\n\t* Not urgent or important (Eliminate)\n\n**4. Use a task management system**: Tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira can help you organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate with team members.\n\n**5. Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Divide large tasks into smaller, manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. This will also help you make progress and feel a sense of accomplishment.\n\n**6. Learn to say no**: Be mindful of taking on too much at once. Politely decline non-essential tasks that may derail your focus from the campaign.\n\n**7. Take breaks and practice self-care**: Working long hours can lead to burnout. Take regular breaks, exercise, and prioritize your physical and mental well-being.\n\n**8. Communicate with your team and manager**: Don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance when needed. Communicate your workload and deadlines to your team and manager to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n**9. Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, adjust your schedule as needed, and celebrate your accomplishments.\n\n**10. Stay organized digitally**: Keep your computer files and emails organized, this will save you time and reduce stress.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following:\n\n* Identify your most productive hours of the day and schedule your most important tasks during that time.\n* Minimize distractions, such as turning off notifications or finding a quiet workspace.\n* Use automation tools to streamline repetitive tasks.\n* Set boundaries with colleagues and clients to maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\nRemember, time management and prioritization are skills that take practice, so don't be too hard on yourself if you don't get it right immediately. Keep experimenting and adjusting your approach until you find what works best for you.\n\nHow do these tips sound?

Here are some general guidelines to help you get started:\n\n**Facebook:**\n\n* Posting frequency: 3-5 times per week\n* Peak engagement times: 12 pm, 3 pm, and 9 pm (EST)\n* Avoid overposting: Facebook's algorithm prioritizes content from friends and family, so overposting can lead to decreased visibility.\n\n**Twitter:**\n\n* Posting frequency: 5-10 times per day\n* Peak engagement times: 12 pm, 3 pm, and 5 pm (EST)\n* Twitter is a fast-paced platform, so posting frequently is acceptable. However, avoid overposting, as it can lead to clutter and decreased engagement.\n\n**Instagram:**\n\n* Posting frequency: 3-5 times per week\n* Peak engagement times: 12 pm, 5 pm, and 8 pm (EST)\n* Instagram is a visually-oriented platform, so focus on quality over quantity. Posting too frequently can lead to decreased engagement.\n\n**LinkedIn:**\n\n* Posting frequency: 2-3 times per week\n* Peak engagement times: 10 am, 12 pm, and 2 pm (EST)\n* LinkedIn is a professional platform, so focus on sharing valuable, informative content. overposting can lead to decreased engagement.\n\n**General Guidelines:**\n\n* Start with a lower posting frequency and adjust based on engagement and audience feedback.\n* Consider your audience's time zone and schedule your posts accordingly.\n* Space out your posts to avoid flooding your audience's feeds.\n* Mix up the types of posts you create, including videos, images, links, and text-only updates.\n* Use analytics tools to track engagement and adjust your posting frequency based on performance.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider using a \"batching\" approach, where you create content in bulk and schedule it in advance.\n* Use social media automation tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social to streamline your posting process.\n* Experiment with different posting frequencies and analyze the results to find what works best for your audience.\n* Don't sacrifice quality for quantity.

It helps you understand whether your campaign is generating revenue and if it's worth continuing to invest in it.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you spent $1,000 on a social media ad campaign and it generated $1,500 in revenue. To calculate the ROI:\n\nROI = ($1,500 - $1,000) / $1,000 = 50%\n\nThis means that for every dollar you spent on the campaign, you earned a 50% return.\n\n**Why ROI matters:**\n\n1. **Justifies campaign spend**: ROI helps you determine if your campaign is generating enough revenue to justify the cost.\n2. **Optimize budget allocation**: By comparing ROI across different campaigns or channels, you can allocate your budget more effectively.\n3. **Improves decision-making**: ROI provides a data-driven approach to decision-making, helping you prioritize campaigns that generate the highest returns.\n\n**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**\n\nCAC measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, including all the expenses involved in convincing a potential customer to make a purchase.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nCAC = (Total Marketing and Sales Expenses) / Number of New Customers Acquired\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you spent $10,000 on marketing and sales efforts last quarter and acquired 100 new customers. To calculate the CAC:\n\nCAC = $10,000 / 100 = $100 per customer\n\nThis means that it costs you $100 to acquire each new customer.\n\n**Why CAC matters:**\n\n1. **Identifies inefficiencies**: High CAC can indicate inefficient marketing or sales strategies, allowing you to optimize and reduce costs.\n2. **Pricing strategy**: CAC helps you determine the minimum price you need to charge to break even and ensure profitability.\n3. **Customer lifetime value**: By comparing CAC to customer lifetime value (CLV), you can determine whether your customer acquisition strategy is sustainable.\n\nBy tracking ROI and CAC, you'll gain valuable insights into your campaign's financial performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing strategy.\n\nDo you have any questions about calculating ROI and CAC or how to apply these metrics to your campaign?"

These goods were often in high demand in Europe, which meant that there was significant profit to be made.\n\n2.

However, the Crusaders had a significant naval fleet, which provided protection for European merchants traveling to the Holy Land.\n\n3.

This meant that the competition in the markets of the Middle East and Asia was less than it would have been otherwise, which gave European merchants an advantage.\n\n4.

        "content": "You are correct that the Crusades did contribute to the spread of diseases like the bubonic plague due to the large numbers of people traveling to and from the Holy Land. However, it is important to remember that people during the medieval period did not have the same understanding of medicine and disease that we do today.\n\nMoreover, the potential benefits of participating in the Crusades were significant enough that many people were willing to take the risk. For example, the merchants saw the Crusades as an opportunity to gain access to new markets and customers for their goods. Similarly, the nobility saw the Crusades as a way to expand their wealth and power.\n\nAdditionally, the religious motivations behind the Crusades cannot be overlooked. For many Europeans, the Crusades were seen as a holy mission to reclaim the Holy Land from the infidels. The idea of earning salvation or atoning for sins was a powerful motivator for many people.\n\nOverall, while the risks associated with the Crusades were significant, the potential benefits, both economic and religious, were powerful motivators for many people to take the risk and participate in the Crusades."

Decomposers: Fungi are decomposers and break down organic matter such as dead plants, animals, and other organic matter. This process releases nutrients and minerals that can nourish the soil and provide essential building blocks for plants and other organisms.\n\n2. Symbiotic relationships: Fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants such as mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the plants where the fungi provide essential nutrients and minerals to the plant, while the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates and other nutrients.\n\n3. Improves soil structure: The hyphae (thin, thread-like structures) of fungi penetrate the soil and anchor themselves tightly to soil particles. This helps to improve soil structure and reduce soil erosion.\n\n4. Enhances nutrient absorption: Fungi can absorb nutrients and minerals from the soil and other organic matter more efficiently than plants. When the fungi decompose organic matter, they release nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which are essential elements for plant growth.\n\n5. Disease control: Fungi can also help control plant diseases. Some species of fungi can produce and release antibiotics that can inhibit the growth of harmful plant pathogens.\n\nOverall, fungi play an essential role in maintaining healthy soil ecosystems. They contribute to soil structure, nutrient availability, and disease control."

In return for plant-sourced carbon and energy, the mycorrhizal fungi provide the plant with essential nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium, which the plant might not be able to access otherwise. This association is beneficial for both partners as the plant benefits from nutrient uptake while the fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant."

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of over 80% of all plant species, including grasses, legumes, and most crop plants. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, on the other hand, are mainly associated with woody plants and form symbiotic associations with trees and shrubs such as oaks, pines, birches, and willows. \n\nSo, mycorrhizal fungi are fundamental components of soil ecosystems and play a crucial role in the growth and survival of many plants in diverse ecosystems."

These fungi are found in the roots of many agricultural crops such as corn, wheat, and soybeans, and are also important for the growth and survival of many wild plant species.\n\nEctomycorrhizal fungi, on the other hand, form more specific associations with trees and shrubs, particularly with conifers like pines, firs, and spruces. These fungi are also found in hardwoods like oaks, birches, and beeches.\n\nThere are also differences in the way that different plant species interact with these fungi. For example, some plants can only utilize nutrients provided by mycorrhizal fungi, while others can access nutrients in the soil directly, and some can do both.\n\nOverall, mycorrhizal fungi and their associations with plants are incredibly diverse, and the specific associations that form can vary between different environments and ecosystems."

And, of course, I'd be happy to share some tips for making the perfect scrambled eggs:\n\n**Tips for making the perfect scrambled eggs:**\n\n1. **Fresh eggs**: Use fresh, high-quality eggs for the best flavor and texture.\n2. **Whisk them well**: Whisk the eggs gently but thoroughly with a fork or whisk until the whites and yolks are fully incorporated.\n3. **Add a splash of milk or cream**: Adding a small amount of milk, cream, or even water will help create a lighter, fluffier texture.\n4. **Heat control**: Use medium-low heat to prevent the eggs from cooking too quickly. You want to cook them slowly and gently to achieve a tender, creamy texture.\n5. **Butter or oil**: Use a small amount of butter or oil in the pan to prevent the eggs from sticking and to add flavor.\n6. **Don't over-stir**: Let the eggs cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute before stirring. Then, gently push the cooked eggs towards the center of the pan, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the edges. Repeat this process until the eggs are almost set.\n7. **Don't overcook**: Scrambled eggs should be cooked until they're just set and still slightly moist. Overcooking will make them dry and rubbery.\n8. **Add flavor**: Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. You can also add diced herbs (chives, parsley, or dill), grated cheese, or a sprinkle of paprika for extra flavor.\n\n**Tips for adding avocado to your scrambled eggs:**\n\n1. **Mash it up**: Mash the avocado in a separate bowl before adding it to the scrambled eggs. This will help distribute the creamy texture evenly.\n2. **Add it towards the end**: Add the mashed avocado towards the end of the cooking process, so it heats through slightly and combines with the eggs.\n3. **Don't over-mix**: Gently fold the avocado into the eggs to avoid creating a chunky, unappetizing texture.\n\nNow, go ahead and give those scrambled eggs a try! And don't hesitate to experiment with different seasonings and ingredients to make them your own.\n\nEnjoy your breakfast burritos, oatmeal bowls, and yogurt parfaits!"

This will prevent air, moisture, and pests from getting in.\n2. **Cool, Dry Place**: Keep your trail mix in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing it near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Layering**: Layer your trail mix ingredients in the container to prevent them from getting stale or crushed. Start with the nuts, followed by the seeds, dried fruits, and chocolate chips (if using).\n4. **Portion Control**: Divide your trail mix into smaller portions (about 1/4 cup or 1 ounce) and store them in individual bags or containers. This will help maintain freshness and prevent staleness.\n5. **Freezer Storage**: If you don't plan to consume your trail mix within a few weeks, consider storing it in the freezer. This will help preserve the freshness and flavor of the ingredients. Simply scoop out the desired amount and let it thaw at room temperature.\n6. **Check on It**: Regularly check your trail mix for signs of staleness, such as rancid nuts or moldy dried fruits. Discard any spoiled ingredients and refresh your mix as needed.\n\n**Tips for Longer Shelf Life**\n\n1. **Use Fresh Ingredients**: Start with fresh, high-quality ingredients to ensure your trail mix stays fresh for a longer period.\n2. **Roast Your Nuts**: Roasting your nuts can help extend their shelf life. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and roast in a 350°F oven for 10-15 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n3. **Dry Your Fruits**: If you're using dried fruits, make sure they're completely dry and not sticky. You can dry them in a low-temperature oven (150°F) for a few hours to remove excess moisture.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your delicious homemade trail mix for a longer period while maintaining its freshness and flavor.

The stray bullet hits Dr. Penelope, causing her to bleeding out. In the commotion, Surgey responds by firing back on Marcus as well as the shocked Jillian, killing them both. Without the manpower to fight the zombies, nor the courage to face the US government after the death of three government officials at \"his hands\", Surgey simply runs. Without military contact the spread from the lab is uncontained, leading to immediate doomsday of continental America. B3cause the military was never alerted to the outbreak at the main lab, they also never check on the situations of the labs dotted throughout the rest of North and South America, leading to more sources of spread for the parasite as well as the zombie masses. As you can imagine, this cripples the America's to essentially an exclusion zone. Additionally, small parasite outbreaks begin being reported across the coasts of Africa, Europe and Russia as boats carrying hidden parasites or infected corpses cross while fleeing the carnage.\n\nMaps in this timeline would follow groups of survivours trying their best to piece together what they can of society while trying not to be eaten alive. Eventually, and rather miraculously, I imagine Surgey would meet a group of survivours while trapped in a bunker somewhere. He would likely have lost his mind at this point and would manipulate this group, telling them that there is a large settlement unaffected in Northern Canada and, if they follow his instructions, they can carpet bomb a border around this region to keep them safe from future hordes. In reality, these bombs would be filled with parasites and aimed at the USSR, a country that Surgey sees as having abandoned him in American hands and refusing to do anything to stop the parasite in the Americas. This, ultimately, results in apocalypse in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well, spelling the end kf the world.\n\nAnd that's all!

Here are a few thoughts I have on each path and the prologue:\n\nPrologue:\n\n* I think the prologue sets the scene well and gives players an idea of the world they'll be entering.\n* It might be interesting to include some foreshadowing or hints about the three paths to come, to get players thinking about the choices they'll make later on.\n\nPath 1:\n\n* I like the idea of this being the \"best\" path, with the characters successfully alerting the military and working together to fight off the zombie hordes.\n* One thing that might make this path even more engaging is if there are some tough choices the characters have to make along the way, such as deciding whether to risk their own safety to save others, or deciding whether to trust someone who may be an ally or an enemy.\n* It might also be interesting to explore the aftermath of the military's intervention - for example, how the surviving characters and other survivors might adjust to life in a post-apocalyptic world, and what challenges they might face in rebuilding.\n\nPath 2:\n\n* This is definitely a darker turn, but it could also be very compelling from a storytelling perspective.\n* One thing I would suggest is that you make sure the characters' motivations for their actions are clear - for example, why did Marcus shoot Surgey? Why did Surgey respond by killing Marcus and Jillian? This will help players understand the consequences of their choices and make the story more impactful.\n* It might also be interesting to explore how the characters' relationships with each other are affected by these events - for example, do they start to distrust each other, or do they band together even more tightly in the face of adversity?\n\nPath 3:\n\n* This is definitely the darkest timeline, but it also has the potential to be the most gripping and intense.\n* One thing I would suggest is that you make Surgey's descent into madness and manipulation feel believable and grounded in his character - for example, maybe he has a history of feeling abandoned or mistreated by authority figures, which drives his hatred of the USSR.\n* It might also be interesting to explore how the other survivors in the bunker react to Surgey's plan - do they realize what he's up to, or are they manipulated by him as well?\n\nOverall, I think one thing that could make your game even more engaging is if there are consequences to the player's choices that ripple through the timelines. For example, maybe if the player makes choices in Path 1 that save certain characters, those characters might show up later in the other paths, or maybe certain events in Path 3 could be prevented if the player made different choices in the previous paths. This would give players a greater sense of agency and make the story feel more interconnected."

        "content": "Sure, here are some communication protocols that could be used in each scenario, along with the reasons for choosing them:\n\n1. Smart HVAC Systems:\n\nProtocol: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)\n\nReasons: MQTT is a lightweight, efficient, and reliable protocol that is well-suited for IoT applications. It is designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency networks, making it a good choice for transmitting sensor data over a wireless network. It also supports publish/subscribe messaging, which makes it easy to implement a scalable and flexible system.\n\n2. Smart Lighting Systems:\n\nProtocol: Zigbee\n\nReasons: Zigbee is a low-power, low-data-rate wireless communication protocol that is commonly used in home automation and IoT applications. It is designed for short-range communication and has low power consumption, which makes it ideal for transmitting sensor data from occupancy and ambient light sensors. It also supports mesh networking, which enables devices to communicate with each other and extend the range of the network.\n\n3. Smart Energy Management Systems:\n\nProtocol: Modbus TCP/IP\n\nReasons: Modbus TCP/IP is a widely-used communication protocol in the industrial automation and control systems industry. It is designed for real-time communication between devices and supports both Ethernet and serial communication. It is a reliable and secure protocol that can be used to collect data from energy meters and other devices in the system.\n\n4. Smart Inventory Management Systems:\n\nProtocol: RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)\n\nReasons: RFID is a wireless communication protocol that is commonly used for inventory tracking and management. It uses radio waves to transmit data between a reader and an RFID tag, which can be attached to inventory items. RFID tags can store large amounts of data and can be read from a distance, making it easy to track inventory levels in real-time.\n\nIn summary, the choice of communication protocol depends on several factors, including the type of data being transmitted, the distance between devices, the power requirements, and the reliability and security requirements of the system. MQTT is a good choice for transmitting sensor data over a wireless network, Zigbee is ideal for short-range communication, Modbus TCP/IP is commonly used in industrial control systems, and RFID is commonly used for inventory tracking and management."

        "content": "Thank you for providing more information about your laptop and usage patterns!\n\nBased on your description, it's possible that the battery life degradation is due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. **Battery aging**: As batteries get older, their capacity to hold a charge decreases. After 2 years, it's not uncommon for laptop batteries to lose some of their original capacity.\n2. **Usage patterns**: While you mentioned you don't do much gaming, you do engage in resource-intensive activities like video streaming, which can consume more power than web browsing or document work.\n3. **Power management**: Keeping your laptop plugged in most of the time can affect the battery's calibration and overall health. Lithium-ion batteries, like the one in your Dell XPS, have a limited number of charge cycles before they start to degrade.\n\nTo help you troubleshoot and improve your battery life, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Check your battery health**: Download and install Dell's Power Manager software (if you haven't already). This will give you a better idea of your battery's health and capacity.\n2. **Update your BIOS and drivers**: Ensure your laptop's BIOS and drivers are up-to-date, as newer versions often include power management improvements.\n3. **Adjust your power settings**: Go to your Power Options in the Control Panel (Windows) and adjust the settings to optimize battery life. You can set the screen brightness to auto-adjust, turn off unnecessary devices, and adjust the power plan to \"Balanced\" or \"Power Saver.\"\n4. **Implement good charging habits**: Try to keep your battery level between 20% and 80% charged if possible. Avoiding letting it drop to 0% on a regular basis. When you do need to charge, try to charge it in short bursts (e.g., 30 minutes) rather than leaving it plugged in for extended periods.\n5. **Monitor your system for resource-intensive programs**: Use the Task Manager (Windows) to monitor which programs are consuming the most resources. Close any unnecessary programs or background applications to conserve power.\n6. **Consider calibrating your battery**: Calibrate your battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to help the battery gauge its capacity more accurately.\n7. **Clean dust from your laptop's vents**: Dust can block airflow and cause your laptop to overheat, which can drain the battery faster. Use compressed air to clean out the vents and fans.\n\nIf you've tried these steps and your battery life is still not satisfactory, you might consider replacing the battery. You can contact Dell or a authorized service center for guidance on replacing the battery or checking if it's still under warranty.\n\nKeep in mind that battery life degradation is a normal process, and it's not uncommon for laptop batteries to last around 2-3 years before needing replacement.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about your laptop's battery life?"

Here are some tips to help you avoid getting sucked into social media:\n\n1. **Remove social media apps from your phone's home screen**: Move them to a folder or a secondary screen to reduce the temptation to mindlessly scroll.\n2. **Use website blockers or app blockers**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd can block social media sites or apps during certain times of the day or for a set period.\n3. **Schedule social media checks**: Allow yourself to check social media only during specific times of the day, like during your scheduled breaks or after completing a task.\n4. **Use social media tracking tools**: Apps like RescueTime or Moment can track your social media usage, providing insights into how much time you're spending on each platform.\n5. **Replace social media with a more productive habit**: When you feel the urge to check social media, replace it with a more productive habit, like reading an article, taking a short walk, or doing a quick exercise routine.\n6. **Unfollow or mute distracting accounts**: Remove or limit your exposure to accounts that tend to distract you the most or make you feel bad about yourself.\n7. **Set a \"no social media\" rule during certain times**: Designate specific times of the day or week as \"social media-free,\" like during your morning routine or on Sundays.\n8. **Use social media with a purpose**: When you do check social media, have a specific goal in mind, like catching up with friends, staying updated on industry news, or seeking inspiration.\n9. **Create a social media-free zone**: Designate a specific area, like your workspace or bedroom, as a social media-free zone to help you stay focused.\n10. **Reward yourself for staying on track**: Set small rewards for yourself when you stay away from social media for a certain amount of time or complete a task without getting distracted.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits, so be patient and kind to yourself. Start with small changes and gradually work your way up to more significant ones.\n\nHow do you think you'll implement these tips?"

By removing the apps, you'll make it more difficult for yourself to access them impulsively, which can help you break the habit.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Reduced temptation: By removing the apps, you'll reduce the likelihood of mindless scrolling and impulse checking.\n* Increased productivity: You'll be less likely to get sucked into social media during your work sessions, helping you stay focused on your thesis project.\n* Improved mental health: Reducing social media usage can lead to improved mental health, reduced anxiety, and increased self-esteem.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Inconvenience: You might need to access social media for legitimate reasons, like staying updated on industry news or communicating with friends and family.\n* Limited access: You might need to use a computer or another device to access social media, which could be inconvenient if you're used to checking your phone.\n\nIf you decide to delete the apps, you can always reinstall them later if you need to. It's not a permanent decision, and it might be a good experiment to see how it affects your productivity and mental health.\n\nHere's a compromise: You could delete the apps from your phone, but keep them on your tablet or computer. This way, you can still access social media when you need to, but it won't be as easily accessible on your phone.\n\nWhat do you think?

Here are some tips to help you do it effectively:\n\n1. **Identify your goals**: Before you start unfollowing or muting accounts, think about what you want to achieve. Do you want to reduce noise, focus on specific topics, or connect with like-minded individuals?\n2. **Use Twitter's built-in features**: Twitter has a \"Mute\" feature that allows you to silence accounts without unfollowing them. You can also use the \"Not Interested\" button to remove tweets from your timeline.\n3. **Unfollow accounts that don't add value**: Be ruthless – if an account no longer provides value, entertainment, or inspiration, consider unfollowing it. This includes accounts that post too frequently, share irrelevant content, or make you feel bad about yourself.\n4. **Categorize accounts**: Group accounts into categories, such as \"Industry News,\" \"Inspirational,\" \"Friends,\" or \"Humor.\" This can help you identify accounts that don't fit into your desired feed.\n5. **Use Twitter lists**: Create lists to categorize accounts and make it easier to find relevant content. You can create lists for specific topics, interests, or communities.\n6. **Use third-party tools**: Tools like TweetDeck, Hootsuite, or Twitter Analytics can help you identify inactive accounts, spam accounts, or accounts that don't engage with you.\n7. **Purge accounts that make you feel bad**: If an account consistently makes you feel bad about yourself, anxious, or stressed, consider unfollowing or muting it. Your mental health is important!\n8. **Regularly review your follows**: Schedule regular reviews of your Twitter follows to ensure they still align with your goals and interests.\n\nRemember, unfollowing or muting accounts is not about being rude or unfriendly; it's about curating a feed that supports your well-being and goals.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach unfollowing or muting accounts on Twitter?"

        "content": "Human activity has had a significant impact on the River Plate and its ecosystem over time. The following are some of the key ways in which human activity has impacted the River Plate:\n\n1. Pollution: Industrialization and urbanization have led to increased pollution of the river. Wastewater, agricultural runoff, and industrial discharge have contributed to water quality degradation, which has harmed aquatic life and fisheries.\n\n2. Overfishing: Overfishing has been a significant problem in the River Plate for centuries, and it has had a devastating effect on fish populations. Large commercial fishing fleets have harvested fish at unsustainable levels, resulting in the depletion of once-abundant species.\n\n3. Habitat loss: Development along the river and its tributaries has led to the loss of critical habitats for many species. Urbanization, dredging, and land-use changes have altered river flow, reduced water quality, and harmed wetland ecosystems.\n\n4. Invasive species: Introduced species from other regions or countries have taken over native habitats and disturbed the balance of the ecosystem. One example is the common carp, which was introduced for recreational fishing and has become a nuisance, damaging riverbanks and making it harder for native species to thrive.\n\n5. Climate change: Climate change is affecting the River Plate and its ecosystem in many ways, including increased temperatures, sea level rise, and changing precipitation patterns. These changes can impact both aquatic and terrestrial species, making it difficult for them to adapt to new conditions.\n\nOverall, human activity has caused significant ecological changes in the River Plate ecosystem, and it is critical to address these issues to maintain its health and preserve the biodiversity of the region."

Also, stricter regulations are being enforced to prevent discharge of pollutants into the river.\n\n2. Habitat restoration: Efforts are underway to restore degraded habitats in the wetlands, floodplains, and estuaries along the river. This includes the creation of protected areas, habitat restoration for native species, and the reintroduction of threatened species.\n\n3. Fishery management: Regulations have been put in place to regulate fishing activities and reduce overfishing. Additionally, aquaculture activities have been promoted to reduce pressure on wild fish populations.\n\n4. Invasive species control: Authorities are working to control the spread of invasive species in the river by implementing measures like screening and control programs, monitoring of invasive species spread, and introduction of biological control agents.\n\n5. Climate change mitigation measures: Strategies such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting adaptation measures are being implemented to mitigate and counteract the effects of climate change on the River Plate ecosystem.\n\nOverall, these efforts are important to protect the River Plate ecosystem and its biodiversity for future generations."

Education and outreach: Many organizations have launched public education programs to raise awareness about the importance of the River Plate ecosystem and the need for conservation. The programs include workshops, seminars, and campaigns to educate the public on sustainable management practices.\n\n2. Community-based monitoring: Engaging local communities in scientific monitoring programs helps create a sense of ownership, responsibility, and understanding of the river's ecology. This kind of monitoring provides unique insights into the local knowledge of the river and its ecosystem, which could be integrated into the management process.\n\n3. Sustainable livelihoods: Supporting sustainable tourism, fishing practices, and other economic activities that involve local communities helps promote conservation efforts. Additionally, involving local communities in resource management decisions helps ensure that their needs and perspectives are considered in the conservation process.\n\n4. Collaboration: Government, non-governmental organizations, and local communities are working together to coordinate conservation efforts. They have established forums to bring stakeholders to the table to discuss shared resources, engage in science, and develop coordinated management systems.\n\nOverall, the active participation of local communities in conservation efforts is essential for the sustainable management of the River Plate ecosystem. It helps build a sense of stewardship, enables knowledge exchange and local input, and promotes collective ownership of resources."

Optimizing your GPS settings can indeed make a big difference in ensuring you arrive at soccer practice on time and with minimal stress. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your GPS navigation system:\n\n**1. Ensure GPS accuracy:**\n\t* Make sure your phone's GPS is enabled and set to use the highest accuracy mode (usually labeled as \"High Accuracy\" or \"Precise Location\").\n\t* Check that your phone's location services are enabled and allowed for your GPS app.\n\n**2. Update your GPS app:**\n\t* Regularly update your GPS app to ensure you have the latest maps, features, and bug fixes.\n\t* Check for updates on your app store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store).\n\n**3. Choose the right GPS mode:**\n\t* Use the \"Driving\" or \"Car\" mode to get the most accurate traffic updates and routing.\n\t* If you're walking or biking, switch to the \"Walking\" or \"Cycling\" mode for more suitable routes.\n\n**4. Customize your route preferences:**\n\t* Set your preferred route type (e.g., fastest, shortest, or toll-free) to match your needs.\n\t* Avoid highways or toll roads if you prefer to take local roads.\n\n**5. Use real-time traffic updates:**\n\t* Enable real-time traffic updates to get the latest information on traffic congestion, road closures, and construction.\n\t* This feature can help you avoid traffic jams and plan your route accordingly.\n\n**6. Set your home and work locations:**\n\t* Save your home and work addresses as favorites to quickly access directions and estimate travel times.\n\t* This can also help your GPS app learn your frequent routes and provide more accurate predictions.\n\n**7. Consider alternative routes:**\n\t* If you're familiar with the area, consider using alternative routes to avoid busy roads or construction zones.\n\t* Your GPS app may also suggest alternative routes based on real-time traffic data.\n\n**8. Keep your phone's GPS receiver clean:**\n\t* Make sure your phone's GPS receiver (usually located on the top or back of the device) is free from obstruction and interference from other devices.\n\n**9. Use a GPS app with offline maps:**\n\t* Consider using a GPS app that allows offline maps, such as Google Maps or Waze, in case you lose internet connectivity during your journey.\n\n**10. Keep your phone charged:**\n* Ensure your phone is fully charged before heading out, and consider keeping a car charger handy to top up your battery during long trips.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to optimize your GPS settings for the best results and ensure a stress-free journey to your kids' soccer practice every Saturday morning!"

Here are some points to help you decide:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **High-quality construction:** A premium bike rack is likely built with durable, high-quality materials that will withstand the elements and heavy use.\n2. **Easy to use:** A well-designed bike rack can make it easy to load and unload your bikes, saving you time and hassle.\n3. **Secure and stable:** A good bike rack will keep your bikes secure and stable during transport, reducing the risk of damage or loss.\n4. **Convenience:** A hitch-mounted bike rack can be a convenient option if you have a tow hitch on your vehicle and want a quick and easy way to transport your bikes.\n5. **Style and design:** If you're particular about the appearance of your vehicle, a sleek and stylish bike rack can be a nice addition.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Cost:** $250 is a significant amount to pay for a bike rack, especially if you're on a budget.\n2. **Alternative options:** You may be able to find a more affordable bike rack that still meets your needs.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\n1. **Roof-mounted bike racks:** If you don't have a tow hitch, a roof-mounted bike rack could be a good alternative.\n2. **Trunk-mounted bike racks:** Trunk-mounted bike racks are another option that can be more affordable than hitch-mounted racks.\n3. ** DIY solutions:** If you're handy, you could consider a DIY bike rack solution, although this may not be the most convenient or secure option.\n\n**Ultimately, it's worth it if:**\n\n1. **You plan to use it frequently:** If you plan to use the bike rack regularly, the investment may be worth it for the convenience and peace of mind it provides.\n2. **You value high-quality construction:** If you're willing to pay a premium for a well-built bike rack that will last for years to come, then the investment may be justified.\n3. **You prioritize style and design:** If you're particular about the appearance of your vehicle and want a sleek and stylish bike rack, then the investment may be worth it.\n\nIf you've weighed the pros and cons and decided that the premium bike rack is worth the investment, go for it!

Reviewing policy documents can be overwhelming, but focusing on the right areas will help you make an informed decision. Here are some key points to pay attention to when reviewing your Liberty Mutual home insurance policy:\n\n1. **Coverage limits**: Ensure the policy provides sufficient coverage for your home's value, personal belongings, and liability.\n2. **Deductibles**: Understand the deductible amounts for different types of claims (e.g., wind, hail, theft). A higher deductible can lower your premium, but you'll pay more out-of-pocket for claims.\n3. **Policy exclusions**: Review the list of events or items not covered by the policy, such as flood damage, earthquakes, or certain types of water damage.\n4. **Replacement cost value (RCV) vs. actual cash value (ACV)**: RCV covers the cost to replace or repair your home and belongings with similar materials, while ACV pays the depreciated value. Ensure you understand which type of coverage is included.\n5. **Liability coverage**: Check the coverage limits for liability claims, such as injuries or property damage to others.\n6. **Personal property coverage**: Review the coverage limits for personal belongings, such as jewelry, electronics, or artwork. You may need to purchase additional coverage for high-value items.\n7. **Additional living expenses**: If you're unable to live in your home due to damage, this coverage helps with temporary housing and living expenses.\n8. **Discounts**: Look for discounts you may be eligible for, such as multi-policy discounts, security system discounts, or discounts for being a non-smoker.\n9. **Policy duration and renewal**: Understand the policy's term, renewal process, and any conditions for cancellation.\n10. **Claims process**: Review the process for filing claims, including contact information, documentation requirements, and response times.\n\nWhen reviewing the policy documents, make sure to ask yourself:\n\n* Are there any areas where I need additional coverage or higher limits?\n* Are there any exclusions or limitations that concern me?\n* Are the deductibles and premiums reasonable for my budget?\n* Do I understand the claims process and what's required to file a claim?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask your Liberty Mutual agent or representative to clarify any points you're unsure about. It's essential to understand your policy to ensure you're adequately protected in case of unforeseen events.\n\nRemember to also keep your policy documents organized, either digitally or in a physical file, for easy reference.",

These themes often appeared in his films, particularly in how they portrayed the struggles of immigrants and minorities. For example, in films like \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and \"The Divine Lady,\" Lloyd explored issues of social hierarchy and class conflict. In his films, Lloyd often portrayed immigrants as sympathetic figures who had to work hard to fit into American society. \n\nFurthermore, Lloyd's upbringing in Scotland may have influenced his portrayal of nationality in his films. He often dealt with themes of nationalism, particularly in films like \"The Patriot\" and \"The Last Command.\" In these films, he explored the tensions that arise when individuals are forced to choose between loyalty to their country and loyalty to their own personal beliefs.\n\nOverall, Lloyd's identity as an immigrant to the United States influenced his work by instilling him with a keen awareness of the issues facing minorities and immigrants in American society.

        "content": "Sure, here are some specific examples of how Frank Lloyd portrayed the struggles of immigrants and minorities in his films:\n\n1. In \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935), Lloyd portrayed the tensions between British officers and the crew of the HMS Bounty, many of whom were Tahitian natives. The film depicted the crew as sympathetic figures who were mistreated and oppressed by their British superiors. By highlighting the crew's struggles, the film serves as a commentary on issues of colonialism and the exploitation of native populations.\n\n2. In \"The Divine Lady\" (1929), Lloyd explored the class conflict between a working-class man and a wealthy woman in 18th century England. The film depicted the struggles of the working-class man, who was seen as a sympathetic figure struggling to gain social acceptance in a world dominated by the upper class.\n\n3. In \"The Last Command\" (1928), Lloyd portrayed the experiences of immigrants in the United States by exploring the story of a Russian general exiled to Hollywood after the Russian Revolution. The film highlighted the struggles faced by immigrants in a new country, including the challenges of assimilation and the loss of cultural identity.\n\n4. In \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1917), Lloyd explored issues of nationalism by depicting the struggle between the French Revolution and British society. The film portrayed the violence and chaos of the revolution, while also showing the challenges faced by those who tried to maintain their loyalty to their country and traditions in the face of social upheaval.\n\nOverall, Lloyd's films often depicted the struggles and challenges faced by immigrants and minorities in American and British society, offering audiences a glimpse into the complex social and political issues of the time."

        "content": "Yes, Frank Lloyd's portrayal of immigrants and minorities did attract some controversy during his time. For instance, his film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" was criticized by some for its sympathetic portrayal of the Tahitian natives who rebelled against their British oppressors. Similarly, his film \"The Divine Lady\" was criticized for its portrayal of a working-class man who aspired to marry a wealthy woman.\n\nAdditionally, some of Lloyd's films were criticized for their portrayal of race. For instance, his film \"The Blackbird\" (1926) has been criticized for its stereotypical portrayal of African Americans. In the film, a white man disguises himself as a black man and poses as a janitor to infiltrate a criminal gang run by African Americans. The film was criticized for its racist caricatures and negative portrayals of African Americans.\n\nDespite these controversies, Lloyd's films were generally well-received by audiences and critics, and he is remembered as one of the most influential directors of his time."

As our society continues to grapple with issues related to social justice and equality, filmmakers have an important role to play in helping audiences understand and empathize with the experiences of marginalized individuals. By taking a page from Lloyd's book and creating films that explore these issues in a thoughtful and nuanced way, filmmakers today can help spark important conversations and promote greater understanding and social change."

Many of Lloyd's films were made during a period of intense social and political upheaval, when issues related to race, class, and nationalism were at the forefront of public discourse. It's possible that Lloyd was simply working within the constraints of his era and trying to navigate the challenges of creating art that was both socially conscious and commercially successful.\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to know for sure whether Lloyd's controversial portrayals were intentional or accidental, but it's clear that they were an important aspect of his filmmaking style, and they helped to spark important conversations and debates among audiences and critics alike."
