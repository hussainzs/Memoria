The movie features a mix of humor, excitement, and heart, with a talented young cast, including Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, and Corey Feldman.\n\nThe Goonies is suitable for kids aged 8 and above, depending on your child's sensitivity level. The movie has some mild language, brief violence, and a few intense scenes, but overall, it's a fun, family-friendly film. The themes of friendship, teamwork, and believing in oneself make it an excellent choice for kids.\n\n**The NeverEnding Story (1984)**\n\nThe NeverEnding Story is a fantasy film about a young boy named Bastian who discovers a magical book about a world called Fantasia, where a group of creatures are fighting to save their world from destruction. The movie features stunning visuals, memorable creatures, and a beautiful story about the power of imagination and courage.\n\nThe NeverEnding Story is generally suitable for kids aged 7 and above, but it's essential to consider your child's sensitivity level, as the movie deals with some mature themes, such as loss, fear, and the idea of a world ending. There are also some scary scenes and creatures that might disturb younger or more sensitive children. However, the movie's themes of friendship, hope, and the importance of imagination make it a wonderful choice for kids who can handle the more intense moments.\n\nBoth The Goonies and The NeverEnding Story are classics that have stood the test of time, and they're excellent additions to your movie marathon. If you're still unsure, you could always preview the movies yourself or watch them with your kids to gauge their reaction.\n\nWhat do you think?
