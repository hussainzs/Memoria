Focus on optimizing your Facebook Ads for Facebook's algorithm and ad auction, rather than relying on SEO tips.\n* However, if you're driving traffic to your website from Facebook Ads, make sure your website is optimized for conversions, with clear calls-to-action and a seamless user experience.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n1. Refine your targeting by adding more specific interests, behaviors, and demographics to your ad sets.\n2. Test different ad creatives, including images, headlines, and copy, to see what resonates best with your target audience.\n3. Consider setting up conversion tracking and optimizing for CPA or oCPC bidding strategies.\n4.
