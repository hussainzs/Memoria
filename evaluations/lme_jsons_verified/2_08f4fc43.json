Ensure they are reputable, transparent, and have a strong track record of serving the homeless population. You can check websites like Charity Navigator, GuideStar, or the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance to verify an organization's credibility.\n\n**Set Clear Goals and Objectives**: Define what you want to achieve with your food drive or fundraiser. Is it to collect a certain amount of food, raise a specific amount of money, or serve a certain number of people? Having clear goals will help guide your efforts and give your group a sense of accomplishment.\n\n**Communicate Effectively**: Spread the word about your initiative within your Bible study group, and consider reaching out to other church groups, friends, and family to join in. Create a Facebook event, email chain, or use a group messaging app to keep everyone informed and engaged.\n\n**Decide on a Food Drive or Fundraiser**: You can either organize a food drive, where you collect non-perishable items, or a fundraiser, where you raise money to support the organization.

Set aside time for your group to pray for the homeless population, the organization you're supporting, and the success of your initiative. Reflect on the experience and how it relates to your faith, and discuss ways to continue serving the community beyond this event.\n\n**Follow-up and Evaluation**: After the event, take time to:\n\n* Thank everyone involved and acknowledge their contributions.\n* Evaluate the success of your initiative, including the amount of food collected or funds raised.\n* Consider sharing the experience with your church or community, inspiring others to get involved.\n* Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to hosting a successful food drive or fundraiser that makes a meaningful impact in your community.",

It's a tangible reminder that they are not forgotten, and that God cares for them deeply.\n\nHaving a prayer service before delivering the donations is also a great idea. Using the psalms to guide your prayers can help you to focus on God's character and His heart for the poor and needy. It can also be a powerful way to ask for God's blessing on your efforts, and to seek His guidance and wisdom as you serve.\n\nPsalm 146 is a great choice, but you might also consider other psalms that speak to God's care for the poor and needy, such as Psalm 68:5-6, Psalm 72:12-14, or Psalm 112:4-5. You could also consider using Psalm 103, which speaks to God's compassion and mercy towards all people.\n\nRemember to take time to reflect on the psalms and how they relate to your service project. Ask yourselves questions like: What do these psalms teach us about God's character? How do they inspire us to serve others? How can we embody the values and attitudes expressed in these psalms as we serve?\n\nBy incorporating the Book of Psalms into your food drive, you'll not only be serving the physical needs of others, but also nourishing their souls with the hope and encouragement of God's Word.",

Assume the same year, as no years are specified and the narrative order suggests sequential events.\n3.
