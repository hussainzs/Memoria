Some parents swear by baby carriers and use them extensively, while others might not be comfortable with the idea of wearing their baby or might have a different preference for baby-wearing styles.\n\nIf you're considering including a baby carrier in the basket, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Check with the parents**: If you're close to your coworker, you could ask them if they're interested in a baby carrier or if they have a specific brand/style in mind.\n2. **Choose a neutral option**: Opt for a neutral-colored, simple design that can be easily adjusted to fit different body types. This will increase the chances of the parents finding it comfortable and usable.\n3. **Consider a soft-structured carrier**: Soft-structured carriers are often more versatile and easier to use than wraps or slings. They can be a good option for new parents who might not be familiar with baby-wearing.\n4. **Make it a smaller part of the basket**: If you do decide to include a baby carrier, consider making it a smaller part of the overall basket. You could pair it with some other essentials like onesies, burp cloths, and a baby book, so the parents have a variety of items to choose from.\n\nIf you're unsure, you could always opt for a different item that's more universally useful, like a set of baby washcloths, a baby blanket, or a set of baby bottles. These items are often appreciated and can be used by most parents.\n\nRemember, the thought and effort you put into the gift basket are what truly matter.

Here's why they're a great choice:\n\n1. **Multipurpose**: Baby washcloths can be used for bath time, wiping up spills, and even as a makeshift burp cloth in a pinch.\n2. **Gentle on skin**: Look for washcloths made from soft, breathable materials like cotton, bamboo, or muslin. These will be gentle on the baby's skin and reduce the risk of irritation.\n3. **Easy to clean**: Baby washcloths are machine washable and dry quickly, making them easy to clean and reuse.\n4. **Always needed**: New parents will go through a lot of washcloths in the first few months, so a set of 6-8 washcloths will be appreciated.\n\nWhen selecting a set of baby washcloths, consider the following:\n\n1. **Material**: Opt for soft, breathable materials like cotton, bamboo, or muslin.\n2. **Size**: Look for washcloths that are around 6-8 inches square. This size is perfect for bathing and wiping up spills.\n3. **Quantity**: A set of 6-8 washcloths is a good starting point. This will give the new parents a few extras in case some are in the wash.\n4. **Brand and quality**: Choose a reputable brand that's known for producing soft, gentle washcloths.

The conversation history lists three sessions in explicit sequential order: answer_3e9fce53_1 first, then _2, then _3, indicating the chronological progression of the user's messages. 2. Each session uses present-recent temporal phrases ('just...today' in _1 and _3, 'just' in _2) referring to events on the day of that message. 3. Thus, the nursery preparation (session _1) occurred first, followed by the cousin baby shower shopping (session _2), and finally the phone case order (session _3). 4.
