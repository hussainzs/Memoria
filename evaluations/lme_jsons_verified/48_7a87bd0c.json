        "content": "Congratulations on sticking to your daily tidying routine for 3 weeks! That's a great accomplishment, and it's awesome that you're feeling proud of yourself. Now, let's tackle that garage organization project!\n\nSorting through boxes and storage bins can be overwhelming, but with a clear plan, you'll be done in no time. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Prepare for the task**: Set aside a few hours or a whole day, depending on the size of your garage and the amount of clutter. Wear comfortable clothes, and gather some essential supplies like trash bags, labels, and a marker.\n2. **Purge before you organize**: Begin by removing everything from the garage and sorting items into categories (e.g., tools, sports equipment, seasonal decorations, etc.). This will give you a better idea of what you have and help you decide what to keep, donate, or discard.\n3. **Categorize and group similar items**: Once you've purged your items, group similar things together (e.g., all tools, all sports equipment, etc.). This will make it easier to assign a home for each category.\n4. **Assign a home for each category**: Designate a specific area or bin for each category. For example, you might have a toolbox for tools, a bin for sports equipment, and a shelf for seasonal decorations.\n5. **Use vertical space**: Maximize your garage's vertical space by using stackable bins, shelves, or hooks to store items. This will help keep the floor clear and make it easier to access what you need.\n6. **Label everything**: Label each bin, shelf, or category so you can easily find what you need in the future. You can use labels, stickers, or even a label maker to make it more efficient.\n7. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Store frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, while less frequently used items can be stored higher up or towards the back of the garage.\n8. **Consider a \"maybe\" box**: For items that are difficult to decide on, place them in a \"maybe\" box and set a deadline, like six months, to revisit the item. If you haven't used it by then, consider letting it go.\n9. **Take breaks and stay focused**: Organizing a garage can be physically and mentally exhausting. Take breaks to rest and recharge, and try to stay focused on one area at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n10. **Don't forget the floor**: Once you've organized your bins and shelves, don't forget to clean and organize the floor. Sweep, mop, or vacuum the floor to create a clean and tidy space.\n\nRemember, organizing a garage is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Stay committed, and you'll be enjoying your newly organized garage in no time!\n\nHow does that sound? Are there any specific areas of the garage you're struggling with or would like more guidance on?",

        "content": "Purging and categorizing are crucial steps in the garage organization process. Deciding what to keep and what to get rid of can be challenging, but here are some tips to help you make those decisions:\n\n**The 4-Box Method**:\n\n1. **Keep**: Items you use regularly, are in good condition, and bring value to your life.\n2. **Donate/Sell**: Items that are still in good condition but no longer serve a purpose for you. Consider donating or selling them to benefit others.\n3. **Recycle**: Items that can be recycled, such as paper, cardboard, or glass.\n4. **Toss**: Items that are broken, damaged, or no longer useful.\n\n**Additional Questions to Ask Yourself**:\n\n1. **When was the last time I used this item?** If it's been over a year, it's likely you can let it go.\n2. **Do I still have a purpose or need for this item?** Be honest with yourself. If you've outgrown or replaced the item, it's probably safe to let it go.\n3. **Is the item in good condition?** If it's broken or damaged beyond repair, it's likely time to say goodbye.\n4. **Can I replace this item if I need it again?** If the answer is yes, and you don't use it frequently, consider letting it go.\n5. **Does it bring me joy or serve a purpose?** This is a popular question from Marie Kondo's KonMari method. If the item doesn't bring you joy or serve a purpose, it might be time to let it go.\n\n**Common Items to Consider Getting Rid Of**:\n\n1. Broken or damaged items that can't be repaired\n2. Duplicate items (e.g., multiple hammers, tools, or gadgets)\n3. Items that no longer fit or are outdated (e.g., old sports equipment, children's toys)\n4. Items that are no longer relevant to your hobbies or interests\n5. Items that are taking up valuable space and not providing any benefit\n\n**Tips for Letting Go**:\n\n1. **Be ruthless**: It's easy to get attached to items, but remember that keeping cluttered spaces can lead to stress and disorganization.\n2. **Keep the memories, not the item**: If you're holding onto an item due to sentimental value, consider taking a photo of it and letting it go.\n3. **Enlist the help of a friend or family member**: Sometimes having someone else's perspective can help you make decisions about what to keep and what to get rid of.\n\nBy asking yourself these questions and considering these tips, you'll be able to make informed decisions about what to keep and what to get rid of. Remember, the goal is to create a more organized, functional, and peaceful space that reflects your needs and priorities.\n\nHow do you feel about getting started with purging and categorizing your garage items? Is there a particular area or category you're most excited to tackle first?",

        "content": "Excellent choices! Tackling the tools and sports equipment categories will make a big impact on the overall organization of your garage. And getting rid of old furniture will free up valuable space and make it easier to move around.\n\nRemember to be intentional with each item you pick up. Ask yourself the questions I mentioned earlier, and be honest with yourself about whether you really need it or not. It's easy to get caught up in sentimentality or \"just in case\" thinking, but try to stay focused on the benefits of having a more organized and clutter-free space.\n\nAs you work on purging and categorizing, keep these additional tips in mind:\n\n* **Handle each item only once**: Try to make a decision about each item as you pick it up, rather than putting it down and dealing with it later. This will save you time and energy in the long run.\n* **Use a \"maybe\" box**: If you're unsure about an item, put it in a \"maybe\" box and set a deadline to revisit it. If you haven't used it or thought about it by that time, it's likely safe to get rid of it.\n* **Keep similar items together**: As you categorize, group similar items together (e.g., all hammers, all screwdrivers, etc.). This will make it easier to see what you have and what you can get rid of.\n* **Keep the most frequently used items accessible**: Store your most frequently used tools and equipment in easy-to-reach locations, so you can quickly grab what you need when you need it.\n\nFor the old furniture, consider the following options:\n\n* **Donate or sell**: If the furniture is still in good condition, consider donating it to a local charity or selling it online. You can also offer it to friends or family members who might be able to use it.\n* **Repurpose**: Think creatively about how you could repurpose the furniture. For example, an old bookshelf could become a storage unit for tools or sporting equipment.\n* **Dispose**: If the furniture is broken or no longer useful, consider disposing of it responsibly. Check with your local waste management company to see if they offer bulk pickup or special collection for large items.\n\nYou got this! You're taking the first steps towards a more organized and clutter-free garage. Stay focused, and remember to take breaks when you need them. You're making progress, and that's something to be proud of!\n\nHow do you feel about the prospect of getting rid of some of that old furniture?

Getting rid of that desk will not only clear up physical space, but it'll also give you a sense of accomplishment and relief.\n\nRemember, decluttering is not just about getting rid of stuff; it's also about creating space for new possibilities and opportunities. By letting go of the old, you're making room for the new and allowing yourself to focus on what's truly important to you.\n\nAs you prepare to get rid of the desk, take a moment to acknowledge the memories or emotions attached to it. Maybe it was a gift from someone, or maybe it was a piece of furniture from a previous chapter in your life. Acknowledge those feelings, and then let them go. You're not getting rid of the memories; you're simply releasing the physical object that's no longer serving you.\n\nWhen you're ready, take a deep breath, and let that desk go!

Here are some tips to help you make the most of your storage space:\n\n**Choosing the Right Bins:**\n\n1. **Measure your space**: Before buying bins, measure the shelves, corners, and areas where you plan to store them. This will ensure you get bins that fit comfortably and maximize your space.\n2. **Consider the contents**: Think about what you'll be storing in each bin. If you're storing heavy items, look for sturdy bins with reinforced handles. For lighter items, you can opt for lighter-weight bins.\n3. **Stackability**: Since you mentioned stackable bins, make sure they're designed for stacking and have a secure fit to prevent them from toppling over.\n4. **Material**: Decide on the material that suits your needs. Plastic bins are often durable and easy to clean, while metal bins can be more industrial-looking and great for heavy-duty storage.\n5. **Size variety**: Having bins of different sizes will allow you to store items of varying sizes and shapes.\n\n**Labeling Your Bins:**\n\n1. **Clear and concise labels**: Use labels that are easy to read and understand. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that might be confusing.\n2. **Use a label maker**: Invest in a label maker or use a marker to create clear, bold labels. You can also use pre-made labels or stickers if you prefer.\n3. **Color-code**: Consider color-coding your labels to categorize similar items or to indicate the contents of each bin.\n4. **Label the bin and the shelf**: Label not only the bin but also the shelf or area where it's stored, so you can easily find what you need.\n5. **Keep it consistent**: Use a consistent labeling system throughout your garage to make it easy to navigate and find what you need.\n\nSome popular bin and label options include:\n\n* Sterilite or Rubbermaid bins for general storage\n* Label makers like Brother or DYMO for easy labeling\n* Adhesive labels or stickers from brands like Avery or Scotch\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a well-organized and functional storage system in your garage that makes it easy to find what you need when you need it.\n\nHow do you plan to organize your bins and labels?

You can use a service like Shutterfly or Blurb to create the book.\n2. **Customized Baby Blanket or Quilt**: A soft, cozy blanket or quilt with Ava's name, birthdate, or a special message is a thoughtful gift for any baby.\n3. **Adoption-Themed Artwork**: A beautiful piece of artwork or painting that celebrates adoption, love, or family can be a stunning addition to Ava's nursery.\n4. ** Cultural Keepsakes**: A traditional Chinese outfit, a handmade Chinese doll, or a beautiful piece of Chinese-inspired artwork can help Ava connect with her heritage.\n5. **Practical Items**: Diapers, onesies, and baby gear are always appreciated, but consider gifting experiences like a post-adoption counseling session, a meal delivery service, or a baby massage class to support Michael and Sophia in their new role as parents.\n6. **Memory Box**: Create a beautifully crafted memory box or shadow box where Michael and Sophia can store mementos from Ava's adoption journey, such as her adoption certificate, photos, and other keepsakes.\n7. **Subscription Services**: A subscription to a children's book club, a baby clothing service, or a parenting resource platform can provide ongoing support and entertainment for Ava and her parents.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that comes from the heart and shows your love and support for Michael, Sophia, and baby Ava."

You can always adjust your organization structure as you add more photos and trips.\n\nWhat do you think?

        "content": "The Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on June 28, 1919, the official end of World War I, had significant impacts on Europe's political and economic landscape. Some of these impacts include:\n\n1. Germany was held completely responsible for starting the war and had to pay reparations to the Allied powers, which caused economic hardship and instability in Germany.\n\n2. The new map of Europe created by the treaty drew new borders and created new states, including the creation of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which shifted political landscape of the continent.\n\n3. The treaty weakened the Austro-Hungarian Empire and led to its eventual collapse, resulting in several independent countries, including Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovenia.\n\n4. The harsh terms of the treaty led to resentment and bitterness in Germany, which contributed to the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party and led to the outbreak of World War II.\n\n5. The treaty created the League of Nations, which was intended to prevent future wars and promote international cooperation. However, it failed as several major countries, including the United States, refused to join, and it proved ineffective in preventing the aggression of Italy, Germany, and Japan leading up to World War II.\n\nOverall, the Treaty of Versailles had significant impacts on Europe's political and economic landscape, with some of its effects being felt for years, and even decades, after its signing."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "There are several opinions over whether the Treaty of Versailles could have been designed differently to prevent the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party. Some historians argue that the treaty's punitive measures against Germany, such as imposing heavy war reparations and limiting the size of their military, left Germany with a sense of humiliation and financial instability that contributed to the rise of extremist movements like Nazism. Thus, some believe that a more lenient treaty may have prevented the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party.\n\nOn the other hand, it is essential to recognize that the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party was not solely dependent on the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Many other factors, such as the economic crisis of the 1930s, political instability, and deep-rooted anti-Semitism in Europe, played a significant role in the rise of Nazism.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to say whether a different treaty could have prevented the rise of Hitler and Nazism. Still, it is crucial to recognize that the Treaty of Versailles, along with other factors, significantly influenced Europe's political and economic landscape, setting the stage for the Second World War."

French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau famously declared that the treaty was \"not peace, but a truce for 20 years.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Germany had no say in the treaty's terms and was forced to sign it reluctantly. German politicians and citizens saw the treaty as a \"Diktat\" or dictated peace, which was unfair and humiliating. Many Germans were outraged by the treaty's terms, including the forced disarmament of the German army and the imposition of war reparations that Germany could not afford.\n\nThe newly created Eastern European states welcomed the treaty as it recognized their independence, but some of their neighbors, like Russia and Turkey, were unhappy with the territorial changes imposed on them.\n\nIn summary, reactions to the Treaty of Versailles varied widely among European countries, with some seeing it as a victory and others feeling resentful and angry about its terms. These mixed reactions set the stage for the tensions and conflicts that followed in the years after the treaty's signing."

The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) - this treaty between Spain and Portugal divided the New World between the two countries along a line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. This treaty helped establish Spain and Portugal's colonial empires in the Americas and Africa.\n\n2. The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) - this treaty ended the Thirty Years War and established the principle of sovereignty, the idea that individual states had the right to make decisions without interference from other countries. This treaty is often considered the beginning of the modern nation-state system.\n\n3. The Treaty of Paris (1783) - this treaty officially ended the American Revolutionary War and recognized the United States as a new independent nation. The treaty's terms established the boundaries of the new country and set the stage for the growth of the United States.\n\n4. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842) - this treaty between China and Britain ended the First Opium War and opened five Chinese cities, including Hong Kong, to British commerce and residence. This treaty gave Britain and several other countries significant control over Chinese trade and territories.\n\n5. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) - as we have discussed earlier, this treaty officially ended World War I and had a significant impact on Europe's political and economic landscape.\n\nThese are just a few examples of treaties that have had a significant impact on world history. The signing of any treaty represents a significant political and diplomatic event that often shapes future events and the broader political landscape."

However, it's essential to consider the pros and cons of bundling versus listing them individually.\n\n**Bundling:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. Convenience: Buyers who are interested in collecting multiple cameras might appreciate the convenience of purchasing a bundle.\n2. Competitive pricing: You can offer a competitive price for the bundle, making it more attractive to buyers.\n3. Less hassle: You'll only need to handle one sale, and you'll save time on listing and shipping multiple items.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Limited audience: You might limit your potential buyer pool to only those interested in purchasing a bundle.\n2. Pricing challenges: Determining a fair price for the bundle can be tricky, as each camera has its unique value.\n\n**Listing individually:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. Wider audience: You'll attract a broader range of buyers, as each camera will appeal to its specific audience.\n2. Accurate pricing: You can research and price each camera individually, ensuring you get a fair price for each one.\n3. More flexibility: Buyers can choose which cameras they're interested in, and you can negotiate separate sales.\n\nCons:\n\n1. More work: You'll need to create separate listings, handle multiple sales, and ship individual items.\n2. More time-consuming: You'll need to invest time in researching and pricing each camera accurately.\n\nConsidering your collection, I think listing them individually might be the better approach. Since you have a range of cameras, including the Rolleiflex and the Canon rangefinder, each one has its unique value and appeal. By listing them separately, you can attract a wider range of buyers and get a more accurate price for each camera.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to bundle them, make sure to:\n\n1. Research the market: Understand the demand and prices for each camera to determine a fair bundle price.\n2. Highlight the bundle's value: Emphasize the benefits of purchasing a collection, such as the convenience, the variety, and the potential for a better overall price.\n3. Provide detailed descriptions: Make sure to include detailed descriptions and high-quality photos of each camera in the bundle.\n\nUltimately, the decision to bundle or list individually depends on your goals, the condition and value of each camera, and your target audience. If you're unsure, you could start by listing one or two cameras individually and see how they perform before deciding on the best approach for the rest of your collection."

        "content": "The brain is a complex organ that has many different parts that work together to control our thoughts, actions, and emotions. The brain is divided into three main parts: the hindbrain, the midbrain, and the forebrain. \n\nThe hindbrain is responsible for controlling basic bodily functions like breathing and heart rate. It also plays a key role in maintaining balance and coordination.\n\nThe midbrain is involved in processing sensory information from our environment, as well as controlling movement and reflexes.\n\nThe forebrain is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for higher-level cognitive functions like thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving. It also contains the limbic system, which is involved in regulating emotions and memory.\n\nDifferent parts of the brain communicate with each other through a complex system of neural pathways. These pathways allow different parts of the brain to work together to coordinate our thoughts, actions, and emotions.\n\nFor example, when we experience a stressful situation, the amygdala in the limbic system is activated, which triggers a fight or flight response. The prefrontal cortex in the forebrain then weighs the options and decides whether to engage in the fight or flight response.\n\nSimilarly, when we perform a complex motor task like playing the piano, the motor cortex in the forebrain sends signals down to the basal ganglia in the midbrain, which coordinates the movements of different muscle groups.\n\nOverall, the different parts of the brain work together in a highly interconnected network to control our thoughts, actions, and emotions, allowing us to navigate the world around us and respond to different situations appropriately."

For example, regular exercise has been shown to improve memory and increase brain volume in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory consolidation. \n\nSimilarly, practice and repetition can improve skills like playing a musical instrument, which involves complex sensory and motor processing in the brain. \n\nIn addition, cognitive training programs, such as brain training games or memory training exercises, have been developed to target specific cognitive functions. While the effectiveness of these programs is still debated, some studies have shown that they can improve cognitive abilities in older adults and people with cognitive impairments.\n\nOverall, while the extent to which the brain can be trained is still an area of active research, there is evidence to suggest that targeted training can improve specific cognitive functions and enhance overall brain health."

This exercise has been shown to improve working memory and attention, and some studies suggest that it can also improve fluid intelligence (the ability to reason and solve problems).\n\nAnother type of brain training program is called \"Mindfulness Meditation\". It involves focusing your attention on your breathing and observing your thoughts and feelings with a sense of non-judgmental awareness. This practice has been shown to improve working memory, attention, and decision making.\n\nIn addition, some research suggests that games that involve strategy and planning, such as chess, can also improve cognitive functions like memory and decision making.\n\nOverall, it is important to remember that the effectiveness of brain training programs can vary depending on a person's age, cognitive abilities, and the specific program being used.

        "content": "As an AI language model, here are some potential long-term effects of globalization on the global economy:\n\n1. Increased economic interdependence between countries: As globalization continues, countries become more economically interdependent, which can lead to greater economic growth and cooperation.\n\n2. Increased competition: Globalization can lead to increased competition between countries, companies, and industries. This competition can drive innovation, lower prices, and improve quality, but it can also harm industries and workers who cannot compete effectively.\n\n3. Increased inequality: Globalization can exacerbate economic inequality within and between countries. While some individuals and regions may benefit from increased trade and investment, others may be left behind.\n\n4. Environmental degradation: The increased movement of goods and people across borders can lead to environmental degradation, including increased carbon emissions, deforestation, and pollution.\n\n5. Greater risk of economic shocks: As countries become more interconnected, economic shocks in one country or region can have ripple effects around the world.\n\n6. Greater pressure to harmonize rules and regulations: As countries become more economically interdependent, they may face increasing pressure to harmonize laws and regulations to facilitate trade and investment.\n\n7. Increased awareness of global issues: As globalization continues, people become more aware of global issues such as inequality, environmental degradation, and labor rights. This can lead to increased activism and pressure on governments and businesses to address these issues.\n\nOverall, while globalization has brought many benefits to the global economy, policymakers and business leaders must take into account the potential risks and challenges to ensure that globalization benefits all individuals and regions, and is sustainable in the long term."

I'm sure whatever you choose, they'll appreciate the thought and love behind the gift."

The term was originally used in the early 20th century to describe a type of sculpture that incorporated moving parts or elements, and was used to refer specifically to the works of Alexander Calder, an American artist who is credited with inventing the modern mobile.\n\nCalder's mobiles were characterized by their delicate balance and the interplay of weight and movement. The individual elements of the mobile were suspended from a central point by wires or other connectors, allowing them to move and shift in response to air currents or other forces.\n\nOver time, the term \"mobile\" became more broadly associated with any type of hanging or suspended sculpture that incorporates movement or kinetic elements. Today, mobiles can be found in a variety of settings, from homes and nurseries to art museums and public spaces, and are often appreciated for their beauty, complexity, and the sense of movement and dynamism that they bring to a space."

The Moody Blues were a British rock band that emerged in the 1960s, and their music is often associated with the progressive rock and psychedelic rock genres. While it's difficult to trace back the exact influences and inspirations that led to the Moody Blues' unique sound, we can make some educated guesses based on the musical traditions and genres that were popular in the time period when they emerged.\n\nOne possible lineage of influence for the Moody Blues might look something like this:\n\nEarly street blues < Jazz and swing music < Big band music < Rock and roll < British Invasion bands (e.g. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones) < Progressive rock and psychedelic rock\n\nThe influence of early street blues on the Moody Blues' music can be seen in their use of blues-based chord progressions and melodic structures, as well as their incorporation of blues and soul elements in their instrumentation and arrangements. Jazz and swing music may have also played a role in shaping the Moody Blues' sound, particularly in their use of complex harmonies and instrumentation.\n\nThe emergence of rock and roll in the 1950s and 60s, which drew heavily on blues and R&B influences, paved the way for the British Invasion bands of the 1960s. Groups like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, who were heavily influenced by American blues and rock and roll, helped to popularize new sounds and styles that would eventually give rise to the progressive rock and psychedelic rock movements.\n\nOverall, the influences on the Moody Blues' music are likely complex and multifaceted, drawing from a variety of musical traditions and styles. While it's impossible to pinpoint the exact influences and inspirations that led to their unique sound, we can see the traces of various genres and movements throughout their music."

The Beatles were known for their innovative songwriting and arrangements, and their music helped to pave the way for new sounds and styles in popular music.\n\nOne of the key influences on The Beatles' music was Bob Dylan, an American singer-songwriter who was known for his poetic lyrics and folk-inspired sound. Dylan's music drew heavily on the traditions of American folk music, which emphasized storytelling and social commentary.\n\nWoody Guthrie, a legendary folk musician and songwriter, was a major influence on Dylan and many other folk musicians of his era. Guthrie's music often dealt with themes of social justice and labor rights, and his songs were a powerful force in the American folk music movement.\n\nFinally, the influence of American folk music on Guthrie and other artists of his generation can be traced back to the rich traditions of American roots music, including country, blues, and gospel music. These genres were born out of the unique cultural and historical contexts of early America, and their influence can still be heard in many styles of popular music today."

Arbitrary nature of the sign: Saussure argued that the relationship between a sign (a word) and its referent (the object or concept it represents) is arbitrary, meaning that there is no inherent connection between the two. For example, there is no inherent reason why the word \"tree\" should refer to the object it does, and different languages may use different words to refer to the same object.\n2. Signifier and signified: Saussure distinguished between the physical form of a word (the signifier) and the concept it represents (the signified). For example, the word \"tree\" is the signifier for the concept of a large plant with a single trunk and branches.\n3. Langue and parole: Saussure distinguished between langue, which refers to the abstract system of language shared by a community, and parole, which refers to the actual use of language in specific instances.\n4. Synchronic analysis: Saussure emphasized the importance of studying language as it exists at a particular moment in time, rather than studying its historical development over time.\n5. Structural analysis: Saussure's approach to linguistics focused on the analysis of language structure and the relationships between words in a sentence, rather than on the meanings of individual words in isolation. For example, he argued that the meaning of a word can be determined by its position in a sentence and its relationships with other words, rather than by any inherent quality of the word itself."

Here are some examples from \"The Meaning of Meaning\" to illustrate their theory:\n\n* \"The cat sat on the mat\" has a different meaning from \"The mat sat on the cat.\" This demonstrates that the meaning of a sentence depends not only on the individual meanings of the words, but also on their arrangement in the sentence.\n* Ogden and Richards use the example of the word \"red\" to illustrate the difference between a symbol and a signal. The word \"red\" is a symbol because its meaning is arbitrary and conventionally agreed upon by speakers of the language, whereas a signal like a red traffic light has a direct and non-arbitrary relationship with the action it signifies.\n* They argue that the meaning of a word is not simply its referent in the external world, but also the associations and connotations that it carries. For example, the word \"snake\" may elicit feelings of fear or danger in some people due to its negative cultural associations, even if the specific referent of the word is not actually present.\n* Ogden and Richards also introduce the concept of \"contextual definition,\" where the meaning of a word is defined in relation to the specific context in which it is used. They use the example of the word \"line,\" which can have different meanings depending on the context: a line on a map, a line of text, a line in a play, etc."

Chomsky argued that language is not learned through imitation or association, but rather through the activation of an innate linguistic ability in the brain. Here are some examples from his work:\n\n* Chomsky suggested that all human languages share a set of universal grammar rules, such as the ability to form sentences with subject-verb-object order. He provided examples of this universal grammar by analyzing the structures of sentences in various languages.\n* Chomsky argued that the meaning of words is not fixed and static, but rather depends on the context in which they are used. For instance, the meaning of the word \"bank\" can change depending on whether it is used in the context of a river bank or a financial institution.\n* Chomsky proposed the idea of \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" in language. Deep structure refers to the underlying meaning of a sentence, while surface structure refers to the specific words and phrases used to express that meaning. He provided examples to show how different sentences can have the same deep structure, but different surface structures."

Here are some examples from Chomsky's work \"Syntactic Structures\" to illustrate his discussion on the study of word meanings and his theory of generative grammar:\n\n* Chomsky argues that language is innate to the human mind and that there is a \"language acquisition device\" in the brain that allows children to learn language rapidly and effortlessly. He uses examples like the fact that children can easily learn the syntax of a language even though they are not explicitly taught the rules.\n* Chomsky also proposes the idea of a \"deep structure\" in language, which refers to the underlying grammatical structure that generates the surface structure of a sentence. For example, the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse\" and \"The mouse was chased by the cat\" have different surface structures but the same underlying deep structure.\n* Chomsky's theory of generative grammar posits that there are universal rules that underlie all human languages. He uses examples like the fact that all languages have a basic subject-verb-object word order, even though the specific order can vary depending on the language.\n* Chomsky also argues that the meaning of a sentence is not determined solely by the meanings of the individual words, but also by the structure of the sentence. For example, the sentences \"John saw the man with the telescope\" and \"John saw the man with one eye\" have different meanings even though they contain the same words.\n\nThese examples illustrate Chomsky's approach to the study of word meanings and his theory of generative grammar, which have had a significant impact on the field of linguistics."

For example, we might say things like \"he attacked my argument\" or \"I defended my position,\" using military language to describe a verbal exchange.\n2. \"Time is money\" - This metaphor shapes our understanding of time as a commodity that can be spent, wasted, or saved. We might say things like \"I don't have time to waste\" or \"that's a valuable use of my time,\" using economic language to describe a non-material concept.\n3. \"Love is a journey\" - This metaphorical understanding of love frames it as a process that has a beginning, middle, and end. We might say things like \"we've been through a lot together\" or \"we've hit a rough patch,\" using travel-related language to describe the ups and downs of a romantic relationship.\n4. \"Ideas are food\" - This metaphorical understanding of ideas frames them as things that can nourish and sustain us. We might say things like \"that's a meaty argument\" or \"that idea is hard to swallow,\" using culinary language to describe the substance and digestibility of an idea.\n\nThese are just a few examples from Lakoff's work, but they demonstrate how metaphors shape our understanding of abstract concepts and how we use language to communicate those ideas."

These beers will complement the British theme and pair well with your snacks.\n\n**Other ideas:**\n\n1. **Blue-tinted drinks**: Add a few drops of blue food coloring to clear drinks like soda water or lemonade to create a blue hue.\n2. **Manchester City-themed beer glasses**: Use beer glasses or koozies with Manchester City's logo or colors to add to the theme.\n3. **Football-themed drink names**: Come up with creative names for your drinks, like \"The Goalkeeper,\" \"The Pitch,\" or \"The Foul.\" This will add to the fun and playful atmosphere of your party.\n\nRemember to always serve drinks responsibly and encourage your guests to drink safely. Have fun with it, and I hope your Manchester City-themed party is a huge success!"

Please welcome Celestin, Julie, and Benjamin, the talented team behind an innovative animated series that aims to explain cancer to children. Welcome to the show!\n\nCelestin: Thank you, Jimmy! We're thrilled to be here.\n\nJulie: Yes, it's great to be here, and we're excited to share our project with your audience.\n\nBenjamin: Thanks for having us, Jimmy. We're looking forward to discussing our animation with you.\n\n[QUESTIONS]\n\nJimmy Kimmel: So let's jump right in. What inspired you guys to take on such a heavy topic and create a show for kids?\n\nBenjamin: Well, Jimmy, we realized that there's a lack of engaging and age-appropriate content to help kids understand complex health issues, especially cancer. So, we wanted to create something that could not only educate them but also provide comfort and support during difficult times.\n\nCelestin: Our goal is to make a positive impact on children's lives and empower them with knowledge. We believe that understanding cancer can help reduce fear and anxiety around the topic.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Now, let's talk about the characters in your series. Who are they, and how do they help explain the message about cancer to children?\n\nJulie: The main character in our series is a young girl named Lily. She's curious, brave, and determined to learn about cancer after her grandmother is diagnosed with the disease. Along her journey, she meets various characters that represent different aspects of cancer, such as cells, treatments, and support systems.\n\nBenjamin: Each character is carefully designed to be both visually appealing and educational. We use storytelling and engaging narratives to help kids grasp the concepts better.\n\nCelestin: We also made sure to consult with medical professionals to ensure that the information we present is accurate and appropriate for our target audience.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Money talk time! How are you planning to use the funds from your Kickstarter campaign to finance this project? Our viewers would love to know.\n\nCelestin: The funds we raise will primarily go towards covering the costs of production, such as equipment, software, and hiring additional animators and voice actors. Additionally, we will use some of the funds for marketing and distribution to ensure our animation reaches as many children as possible.\n\nJulie: We also plan to allocate a portion of the funds to collaborate with medical professionals and organizations to ensure the quality and accuracy of our content.\n\nBenjamin: Our Kickstarter campaign offers various rewards for backers, including exclusive behind-the-scenes content, personalized artwork, and even opportunities to be involved in the creative process.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: That sounds amazing! Now, what about distribution? How do you plan to reach your target audience with this show?\n\nJulie: We are exploring various distribution channels, including online platforms, schools, hospitals, and healthcare organizations. We want to make our animated series easily accessible to children and families dealing with cancer.\n\nBenjamin: We're also considering partnerships with established media organizations to help reach a broader audience.\n\nCelestin: And, of course, we're open to suggestions from our backers and supporters on how best to share our project with the world.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Alright, that's all the time we have for now. When we come back, we'll dive deeper into the challenges the team has faced and their plans for the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\"Suite\""

The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and, according to some Christian traditions, also from the Son.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is depicted as being active in the world from the beginning of creation, and as playing a key role in the work of salvation. The Holy Spirit is present at Jesus' baptism (Mark 1:9-11), comes upon the disciples at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), and guides and empowers believers in their Christian walk (Romans 8:14-17).\n\nIn the doctrine of the Trinity, the three persons of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are distinct but not separate. Each person is fully God, and yet there is only one God. This means that the Holy Spirit, as the third person of the Trinity, is intimately involved in the divine life and work of God, working in perfect unity with the Father and the Son to accomplish the divine plan of salvation for humanity.\n\nSo, while the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Father and the Son, he is fully a part of the Godhead and plays an essential role in the life and work of the Trinity."

This addition to the Nicene Creed was adopted by the Western Church (Roman Catholic Church) in the 6th century and later by some Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, however, rejected the filioque clause, and it has been a major point of disagreement between the Eastern and Western Churches for over a millennium. Eastern Orthodox theologians maintain that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone and that the filioque clause is an erroneous addition to the Nicene Creed that undermines the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church holds that the Father is the sole source of the Holy Spirit, while the Son is begotten of the Father. They argue that the Holy Spirit's procession from the Father and not the Son is clearly attested to in Scripture and in the early Church Fathers.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to reconcile the theological differences between the Eastern and Western Churches over the filioque clause. However, the issue remains a contentious one, and the filioque remains a point of disagreement and division between the two Churches."

The Christian doctrine of the Trinity teaches that there is one God in three persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Trinity does not deny that God is spirit or that he is a spiritual being. Rather, it affirms that God exists as one divine essence or substance, which is shared equally by the three persons of the Trinity. This means that while the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons, they are all fully God in their essence or nature.\n\nIn the doctrine of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is understood to be a distinct person who is fully God, just as the Father and the Son are. The Holy Spirit is described as having a unique role in the work of salvation, which includes convicting people of sin, guiding them into truth, and empowering them for service.\n\nSo, while the Bible affirms that God is spirit, the doctrine of the Trinity affirms that there are three persons within the Godhead who share the same divine essence or nature. This does not mean that God is divided into three separate parts or that the three persons of the Trinity are each one-third of God, but rather that there is one God who exists eternally and co-equally as three distinct persons."

For example, John 1:1 says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" This passage identifies the Word (who is later identified as Jesus Christ) as both distinct from God and yet also fully God.\n\nSimilarly, in Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands his disciples to baptize people \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\" This passage suggests that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all equally important in the life of the Christian.\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity is an attempt to reconcile the biblical affirmations of the unity and oneness of God with the biblical testimony that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all God.

Being surrounded by nature can provide a sense of tranquility and calmness, away from the chaos and noise of the modern world. This can be especially valuable for characters who are struggling with emotional turmoil or existential questions. The natural world can also serve as a character in its own right, providing a sense of companionship and support for the characters as they navigate their challenges. By immersing characters in nature, authors can create a magical and transformative experience for the reader as well."

If you're using harder vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes, they may take a few extra minutes to cook through.\n* Keep in mind that some vegetables, like leafy greens, may release more water than others. You can either cook them for a shorter time to preserve their texture or add a little more oil to the wok to help them cook more quickly.\n\nSome vegetables that work well in a stir-fry include:\n\n* Leafy greens: spinach, kale, collard greens\n* Cruciferous vegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage\n* Root vegetables: carrots, sweet potatoes, bell peppers\n* Mushrooms: button, cremini, shiitake\n* Alliums: onions, garlic, shallots\n* Other vegetables: zucchini, yellow squash, green beans, snap peas\n\n**Tips for using leftover vegetables:**\n\n* If you're using leftover roasted or grilled vegetables, you can add them towards the end of the stir-fry cooking time, as they're already cooked.\n* If you're using frozen vegetables, make sure to thaw them first and pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n* If you're using vegetables with different cooking times, you can cook them in batches to ensure they're all cooked to your liking.\n\nI hope this helps!

While it's great to be ambitious, it's important to be realistic and strategic about your requests. Negotiating for too many things at once can make your employer feel overwhelmed and lead to a negative outcome. Focus on the benefits that are most important to you and that you feel will have the most significant impact on your overall job satisfaction and performance. The goal is to present your requests in a way that will make your employer see the value of these benefits and perceive their value as small compared to the benefits they will receive from your improved performance. Once you have successfully negotiated one or two benefits, you can use that success to build on and negotiate for additional benefits in the future.

The castle was the site of key events, including the 1916 Easter Rising, where Irish rebels took control of the castle and declared the establishment of an Irish Republic. Today, the Dublin Castle serves as a venue for state visits, presidential inaugurations, and other official events.\n\nThe castle has been extensively renovated over the years, with many of its original structures replaced by the buildings that now make up the complex.

        "content": "Yes, the Easter Rising in 1916 was a pivotal moment in Irish history and is closely tied to the history of the Dublin Castle. The Easter Rising was an armed insurrection in Ireland against British rule, led by a group of Irish Republicans who sought to establish an independent Irish Republic. The Dublin Castle was a symbol of British rule in Ireland and was an important target for the rebels.\n\nOn April 24, 1916, a group of Irish rebels led by Patrick Pearse, James Connolly and others, occupied buildings in Dublin, including the General Post Office, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Dublin Castle. The rebels used the castle as a strategic base from which they controlled the city center. The rebels tried to barricade themselves inside the castle, but they were eventually forced to evacuate after several days of fighting.\n\nThe British government responded with a massive show of force, and after a week of fighting, the rebels were defeated. The leaders of the Easter Rising, including Pearse and Connolly, were arrested, tried, and executed by the British authorities.\n\nThe Easter Rising marked a turning point in Irish history, as it galvanized the nationalist movement and led to the eventual establishment of an independent Irish state. Today, the Dublin Castle serves as a symbol of Ireland's struggle for independence and freedom from British rule. Visitors to the castle can find exhibits and displays that showcase the events of the Easter Rising and the wider Irish struggle for independence."

        "content": "Wonderful! Working with clay can be so rewarding!\n\nYes, understanding the different types of clay bodies is essential for achieving the desired results in your sculptures. Earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain are the three main categories of clay bodies, each with its unique characteristics, advantages, and challenges.\n\n**Earthenware:**\n\n* Firing temperature: Low to medium (1800°F - 2000°F / 980°C - 1093°C)\n* Clay body composition: High percentage of iron, often with added materials like grog or sand\n* Properties:\n\t+ Coarse, porous, and relatively soft\n\t+ Can be prone to warping or cracking\n\t+ May require multiple firings to achieve desired color and strength\n\t+ Often used for functional pieces, like planters, terra cotta pots, and sculptures with a more rustic, earthy feel\n* Glaze compatibility: Earthenware glazes are typically lead-based and more forgiving, but may not be food-safe\n\n**Stoneware:**\n\n* Firing temperature: Medium to high (2100°F - 2400°F / 1149°C - 1315°C)\n* Clay body composition: Lower percentage of iron, higher percentage of kaolin, and often with added feldspar\n* Properties:\n\t+ Dense, strong, and less porous than earthenware\n\t+ Can be thrown thinner and more evenly than earthenware\n\t+ May exhibit a more subtle, nuanced color palette\n\t+ Often used for functional pieces, like cups, bowls, and plates, as well as sculptures with more refined details\n* Glaze compatibility: Stoneware glazes are often feldspathic and more durable, making them suitable for functional ware\n\n**Porcelain:**\n\n* Firing temperature: High (2400°F - 2600°F / 1315°C - 1427°C)\n* Clay body composition: High percentage of kaolin, feldspar, and quartz\n* Properties:\n\t+ Extremely dense, translucent, and strong\n\t+ Can be thrown very thin and delicate\n\t+ Often exhibits a bright, white color\n\t+ Used for delicate, intricate, and detailed sculptures, as well as fine china and decorative pieces\n* Glaze compatibility: Porcelain glazes are typically feldspathic and highly transparent, allowing for vibrant colors and subtle nuances\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and specific clay bodies can vary depending on the manufacturer and recipe. It's essential to understand the specific characteristics of the clay you're working with to achieve the desired results.\n\nWhen choosing a clay body, consider the following factors:\n\n* Your desired aesthetic: Earthenware for a more rustic look, stoneware for a more refined appearance, or porcelain for a delicate, translucent quality.\n* Functionality: If you're creating functional pieces, stoneware or porcelain might be a better choice due to their durability and food-safety.\n* Skill level: If you're new to working with clay, earthenware might be a more forgiving option.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines when working with clay, and happy sculpting!"

        "content": "Congratulations on completing your adorable cat figurine! Pricing your artwork can be a challenging but important step in preparing for a craft fair. Here are some tips to help you determine a fair price for your earthenware sculptures:\n\n1. **Calculate your costs:** Consider the cost of materials, including the clay, glazes, and any other supplies used. Don't forget to factor in the cost of your time, including the time spent on creating, firing, and refining your piece.\n2. **Research the market:** Look at what similar pieces are selling for at craft fairs, online marketplaces, and local art galleries. This will give you an idea of what customers are willing to pay for similar work.\n3. **Consider your skill level and experience:** As a beginner, you may need to price your work lower than an established artist. However, if you've invested significant time and effort into developing your skills, you may be able to command higher prices.\n4. **Size and complexity matter:** Larger, more complex pieces typically require more time and materials, so they should be priced accordingly.\n5. **Pricing strategy:** You can use one of two pricing strategies:\n\t* **Cost-plus pricing:** Add a markup to your total costs to determine the selling price.\n\t* **Value-based pricing:** Price your piece based on its perceived value to the customer, considering factors like uniqueness, craftsmanship, and emotional appeal.\n6. **Round numbers and price anchoring:** Use round numbers (e.g., $20, $50, $100) to make your prices more appealing and memorable. You can also use price anchoring, where you display a higher \"regular\" price next to a lower \"sale\" price to make the latter seem more attractive.\n7. **Be prepared to negotiate:** Some customers may try to negotiate the price, so be prepared to be flexible. However, don't be too quick to lower your prices, as this can devalue your work.\n8. **Display and presentation:** Make sure your sculptures are well-displayed and presented in an attractive manner. This can help justify higher prices and make your work more appealing to customers.\n\nFor a small, intricate earthenware figurine like your cat, you might consider pricing it between $20 to $50, depending on the level of detail and the amount of time invested. If it's a one-of-a-kind piece or has unique features, you may be able to price it higher.\n\nRemember to stay confident in your pricing and be prepared to explain the value and craftsmanship that goes into each piece. Good luck at the craft fair, and I hope your sculptures find new homes!"

Do you want to tell a specific story or convey a particular message?\n* Who is your target audience? If you're targeting a specific group, such as animal lovers or collectors of whimsical art, a consistent theme and style might be more effective.\n* How do you want to differentiate yourself from other artists? If you want to stand out, experimenting with different techniques and styles might be a better approach.\n\nYou could also consider a middle ground, where you have a consistent theme (e.g., animals) but experiment with different styles and techniques within that theme. This approach allows you to maintain a cohesive look while still showcasing your creative range.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your artistic goals, target audience, and personal preferences. You could also test both approaches and see which one resonates with your audience. Good luck with your series, and I hope it's a roaring success at the craft fair!"

        "content": "What a wonderful dilemma to have! Finding a balance between solo travel and traveling with loved ones can be a challenge, but it's definitely possible. Here are some suggestions to help you find a compromise:\n\n1. **Alternate between solo and family trips**: Consider planning a solo trip, followed by a family trip, and then another solo trip, and so on. This way, you'll get to satisfy your desire for independence and exploration while also spending quality time with your loved ones.\n2. **Invite a friend or family member to join you on a solo trip**: This way, you'll still have some alone time, but you'll also have a travel buddy to share experiences with. You can plan activities together, but also have some solo time to recharge.\n3. **Plan a multi-generational trip**: If you have family members of different ages, consider planning a trip that appeals to everyone. For example, a beach vacation or a cruise can be enjoyable for all ages. This way, you'll get to spend time with loved ones while still having some independence.\n4. **Take breaks during family trips**: If you're traveling with family, plan for some solo time or activities during the trip. This could be a morning of solo exploration, a spa day, or a scenic hike while others relax at the hotel.\n5. **Choose destinations that cater to both**: Select destinations that offer a mix of solo activities and family-friendly attractions. For example, cities like Tokyo, New York, or Paris offer plenty of solo exploration opportunities, while also having plenty of family-friendly attractions and activities.\n6. **Consider a 'hub-and-spoke' approach**: Plan a trip where you spend a few days in a central location (the 'hub') with your family, and then take a few solo day trips or excursions (the 'spokes') to nearby destinations.\n7. **Communicate with your loved ones**: Be open with your family about your desire for solo travel and find out what they're comfortable with. They may be more understanding than you think, and you can work together to find a compromise that suits everyone.\n8. **Plan a 'meet-up' trip**: Meet your family or friends in a destination, but plan some solo time before or after the family portion of the trip. This way, you'll get to spend time with loved ones, but also have some independence.\n9. **Look into group tours with solo-friendly options**: Some tour companies cater to solo travelers and offer optional group activities or solo excursions. This way, you can join a group tour with your family, but still have some solo time.\n10. **Be flexible**: Remember that compromise is key. Be willing to adjust your plans or expectations to accommodate your loved ones' needs and preferences.\n\nBy considering these suggestions, you can find a balance between your desire for solo adventures and spending quality time with your loved ones. Happy travels!"

Nausea and vomiting: Some people may experience nausea and vomiting while taking antibiotics, especially if they are taking high doses or multiple antibiotics.\n\n3. Yeast infections: Antibiotics can also kill beneficial bacteria that help keep the yeast in check, leading to overgrowth of yeast and a yeast infection.\n\n4. Sun sensitivity: Some antibiotics can make the skin more sensitive to the sun, increasing the risk of sunburn.\n\n5. Allergic reactions: Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, which can cause a rash, hives, or difficulty breathing.\n\n6. Antibiotic resistance: Long-term use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can be more difficult to treat."

Overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of bacteria that are resistant to the drugs that are typically used to treat these infections. This can make it more difficult and sometimes impossible to treat these infections in the future, increasing the risk of serious illness or death.\n\nLong-term antibiotic use can also disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the gut, which can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea or even a serious condition called Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and even death in some cases.\n\nAdditionally, some people may be allergic to certain antibiotics and could experience a life-threatening allergic reaction if they are exposed to the drug for an extended period.\n\nOverall, it is important to take antibiotics only when necessary, and to follow your doctor's instructions carefully. If you have concerns about prolonged antibiotic use, it is best to discuss them with your doctor to evaluate the risks and benefits of treatment."

        "content": "With acrylics, you have a versatile medium that can produce a wide range of effects.\n\nBased on your preferences, here are some recommendations for paints and brushes that might suit your style:\n\n**Paints:**\n\n1. **Golden High Flow Acrylics**: These paints are known for their excellent lightfastness, vibrant colors, and smooth, buttery consistency. They're a bit pricier than some other brands, but they're worth the investment.\n2. **Liquitex Soft Body Acrylics**: These paints offer a great balance between affordability and quality. They have a smooth, creamy texture and a wide range of colors.\n3. **Winsor & Newton Galeria Acrylics**: These paints are a popular choice among acrylic artists, offering good lightfastness, pigmentation, and a medium-bodied consistency.\n\nFor skin tones, you might want to consider the following:\n\n* **Titanium White**: A must-have for creating subtle, nuanced skin tones. Look for a high-quality, lightfast titanium white that won't yellow over time.\n* **Flesh tones**: Invest in a few good-quality flesh tone paints, such as Burnt Sienna, Raw Umber, and Yellow Ochre. These will help you create a natural, warm base for your skin tones.\n* **Glazes**: Consider using acrylic glazes to add depth and subtlety to your skin tones. You can mix glazes with your regular paints or use them on their own to create thin, transparent layers.\n\n**Brushes:**\n\n1. **Natural hair brushes**: Look for high-quality, natural hair brushes (e.g., sable, mongoose, or synthetic fibers that mimic natural hair). These will give you a more responsive, expressive feel.\n2. **Synthetic brushes**: Synthetic brushes are often more durable and easier to clean than natural hair brushes. They can still produce excellent results, especially for bold, textured strokes.\n3. **Brush sizes and shapes**: Invest in a range of brushes in different sizes and shapes to accommodate your varying strokes and techniques. Round brushes are great for detail work, while flat brushes are better for broad strokes.\n\nSome specific brush recommendations:\n\n* **Winsor & Newton Cotman Brushes**: These are a great, affordable option for natural hair brushes.\n* **Daler-Rowney System 3 Brushes**: These synthetic brushes are known for their durability and versatility.\n* **Royal & Langnickel Soft Brush**: These natural hair brushes are a popular choice among acrylic artists.\n\n**Tips for skin tones:**\n\n1. **Start with a warm base**: Use a warm, earthy tone (e.g., Burnt Sienna or Raw Umber) as your base coat. This will help create a natural, warm foundation for your skin tones.\n2. **Build up gradually**: Use thin layers to build up your skin tones, starting with the lighter areas and gradually adding depth and shadow.\n3. **Mix, mix, mix**: Experiment with mixing different colors to create subtle, nuanced skin tones. Don't be afraid to add a touch of blue or green to create a more realistic, cool undertone.\n4. **Use glazes**: Acrylic glazes can help you achieve a more subtle, transparent look. Mix glazes with your regular paints or use them on their own to add depth and dimension to your skin tones.\n\nI hope these recommendations and tips are helpful!

        "content": "Capturing a child's skin tone can be a challenge, especially when they have a delicate, porcelain-like complexion! Here are some tips to help you achieve a more accurate representation of your niece's skin tone:\n\n**1. Observe the subtleties:** Children's skin tends to be more translucent and delicate than adult skin. Look for the subtle undertones of pink, peach, or yellow in your niece's skin. These undertones can help you create a more accurate and realistic skin tone.\n\n**2. Use a cool palette:** Porcelain-like complexions often have a cooler undertone, so try using a palette with a slightly blue or pink bias. This will help you capture the delicate, smooth quality of your niece's skin.\n\n**3. Mix with Titanium White:** To achieve a more delicate, porcelain-like skin tone, try mixing your colors with Titanium White. This will help to create a soft, gentle appearance.\n\n**4. Pay attention to value:** Children's skin tends to have a higher value (lightness) than adult skin. Make sure to capture the subtle gradations of value in your niece's skin, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n**5. Use glazes:** As I mentioned earlier, glazes can be incredibly useful for capturing subtle, delicate skin tones. Try mixing a glaze with a touch of pink or peach to create a soft, warm undertone.\n\n**6. Study reference images:** Take plenty of reference photos of your niece, and study the way the light interacts with her skin. This will help you capture the subtle nuances of her complexion.\n\n**7. Experiment with layering:** Build up your skin tones gradually, using thin layers to create a sense of depth and dimension. This will help you achieve a more realistic, multi-dimensional appearance.\n\n**Color combinations to try:**\n\n* Mix Titanium White with a touch of Burnt Sienna or Raw Umber to create a warm, peachy undertone.\n* Combine Titanium White with a small amount of Cerulean Blue or Ultramarine Blue to create a cool, porcelain-like undertone.\n* Try mixing Titanium White with a hint of Yellow Ochre or Golden Ochre to add a touch of warmth and depth to your skin tone.\n\nRemember, the key to capturing a child's skin tone is to observe the subtleties and nuances of their complexion. Study your reference images, experiment with different color combinations, and don't be afraid to make adjustments as you go. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you achieve a beautiful, realistic portrait of your niece!"

The disruption of trade, investment, and people movement can hinder economic growth and development opportunities.\n\nOne example is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which has disrupted trade and investment between Israel and nearby Arab countries. The lack of economic cooperation in the region has hindered the development of a more integrated and efficient regional economy.\n\nSimilarly, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, such as the Syrian civil war, have disrupted trade and investment in the region. The ongoing conflicts have resulted in the displacement of millions of people, causing severe economic and social challenges for the neighboring countries.\n\nAnother example is the impact of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia on regional economic ties. The conflict has led to economic sanctions and disrupted trade, causing a significant economic downturn for Ukraine and limiting opportunities for regional economic integration.\n\nIn the long term, these conflicts can hinder economic growth and development opportunities, as they create uncertainty and instability, resulting in a lack of investment, reduced economic activity, and slow development. However, peace and stability can help promote regional economic cooperation, stimulate trade and investment, and drive innovation, leading to significant economic growth and development opportunities."

For example, the World Bank has provided significant financial assistance to countries affected by the Syrian civil war, supporting the delivery of essential services and promoting economic recovery and growth.\n\nFurthermore, international organizations can help create a conducive environment for regional economic cooperation by promoting free trade, increasing market access, and reducing trade barriers. The World Trade Organization, for example, plays a crucial role in promoting trade liberalization and reducing barriers to trade, creating a more favorable environment for regional economic integration.\n\nIn conclusion, international organizations can play a vital role in promoting peace and stability, resolving conflicts, and fostering regional economic cooperation.

That's a great accomplishment, and it's wonderful to hear that it's made a positive impact on your living space.\n\nNow, let's tackle that garage organization project! Here are some tips to help you optimize your storage bins and boxes:\n\n1. **Purge before you organize**: Before you start organizing, take everything out of the garage and sort items into three piles: keep, donate/sell, and discard. Be ruthless – if you haven't used something in a year, it's probably safe to get rid of it.\n2. **Categorize and group similar items**: Once you've purged your items, group similar things together (e.g., all sports equipment, all tools, all seasonal decorations). This will make it easier to assign a home for each category.\n3. **Assign a home for each category**: Designate a specific area of the garage for each category. For example, you might have a section for tools, a section for sports equipment, and a section for seasonal items.\n4. **Use clear and labeled bins**: Use clear plastic bins or containers with labels so you can easily see what's inside without having to dig through everything. You can also use color-coding to differentiate between categories.\n5. **Stack and nest bins**: To maximize vertical space, stack smaller bins on top of larger ones, and nest smaller containers inside larger ones. Just make sure the bins are stable and won't topple over.\n6. **Install shelving and hooks**: Consider installing shelving units or hooks to hang items like bikes, tools, or accessories. This will help keep them off the floor and make the most of your garage's vertical space.\n7. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Store frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, and reserve higher or harder-to-reach areas for less frequently used items.\n8. **Keep a \"launching pad\"**: Designate a specific area, like a pegboard or a small shelf, as a \"launching pad\" for items that need to be used frequently, like bikes or sports equipment.\n9. **Store items by frequency of use**: Store items that you use seasonally or infrequently towards the back or on higher shelves, and keep more frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside some time each month to maintain your organized garage. Go through each category and make sure everything is still organized and in its assigned home.\n\nRemember to take your time, and don't be afraid to get creative with your organization system. Good luck, and have fun with your garage organization project!",

The idea is to handle each item only once, making a decision about it immediately, rather than putting it down and dealing with it later. This can save you time and energy in the long run.\n\nHere are some tips to help you make the \"one-touch rule\" a habit:\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a specific area or task, like cleaning your garage or doing the dishes. As you get comfortable with the habit, you can expand it to other areas of your life.\n2. **Create a decision-making framework**: Develop a simple decision-making process for each item you touch. For example:\n\t* Can I get rid of it?\n\t* Can I donate or sell it?\n\t* Do I need to clean or maintain it?\n\t* Where does it belong?\n\t* Do I need to take action on it (e.g., respond to a letter, pay a bill)?\n3. **Handle each item deliberately**: When you pick up an item, make a conscious decision about what to do with it. Don't just move it from one place to another; deal with it immediately.\n4. **Practice mindfulness**: Be present and focused when cleaning or organizing. Avoid distractions, and try to stay in the moment.\n5. **Use the \"3-box method\"**: When cleaning, use three boxes or containers labeled \"Keep,\" \"Donate/Sell,\" and \"Discard.\" This will help you make quick decisions and keep you from putting items down and dealing with them later.\n6. **Create a \"home\" for each item**: Assign a designated spot for each item, so you can put it away immediately. This will help you develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for keeping things organized.\n7. **Make it a habit loop**: Attach the \"one-touch rule\" to an existing habit or routine, like cleaning or doing chores. This will help you create a mental connection and make it easier to stick to.\n8. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it takes time to develop a new habit. Don't get discouraged if you slip up; simply acknowledge the mistake and try again.\n9. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your successes, even if it's just a small area or task. This will help motivate you to continue the habit.\n10. **Make it a part of your identity**: Tell yourself, \"I'm the kind of person who handles things once and moves on.\" This will help you internalize the habit and make it a part of your daily routine.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make the \"one-touch rule\" a habit that will save you time, reduce stress, and help you maintain a more organized and clutter-free life.",

Here's why:\n\n**RescueTime's tracking limitations:**\n\nRescueTime can only track data from the moment you install the app and start tracking. It doesn't have the ability to retroactively track your data from a previous date. This means that if you install RescueTime today, it will only start tracking your data from today onwards.\n\nHowever, you can still use RescueTime to track your social media usage from now on, and compare your current habits to your previous ones. Here's a workaround:\n\n**Workaround:**\n\n1. **Install RescueTime**: Download and install the RescueTime app on your phone and/or computer.\n2. **Set up tracking**: Follow the setup process to configure RescueTime to track your app usage, including social media apps.\n3. **Wait for a few weeks**: Let RescueTime collect data on your social media usage for a few weeks. This will give you a baseline understanding of your current habits.\n4. **Compare to your previous habits**: Reflect on your experiences during your 10-day social media break and compare them to your current habits. You can use your own observations and notes to compare your pre-break habits to your current ones.\n5. **Analyze your RescueTime reports**: Once you have a few weeks of data, analyze your RescueTime reports to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in your social media usage.\n\nWhile you won't be able to track your social media usage from February 15th onwards, you can still use RescueTime to monitor your current habits and make informed decisions to optimize your social media usage.\n\nRemember, the goal is to understand your habits and make positive changes.

        "content": "Sierra National Forest in November is a great spot for deer hunting! Setting up a tree stand safely and effectively is crucial for a successful and enjoyable hunt. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**Safety First**\n\n1. **Choose the right tree**: Look for a sturdy tree with a wide trunk (at least 8-10 inches in diameter) and a good branch structure to support your stand and your weight. Avoid dead or dying trees, as they can be hazardous.\n2. **Inspect the stand**: Before setting up, inspect your tree stand for any damage or wear. Make sure all straps, chains, and bolts are in good condition.\n3. **Wear a harness**: Always wear a tree stand safety harness while climbing, setting up, and hunting from your stand. Make sure it's properly fitted and attached to the tree.\n4. **Climb safely**: Always maintain three points of contact with the tree (two hands and one foot, or two feet and one hand). Use climbing aids like tree steps or a climbing stick to help you ascend and descend.\n\n**Effective Tree Stand Placement**\n\n1. **Scout before setting up**: Scout the area to identify deer trails, bedding areas, and feeding grounds. Look for signs like rubs, scrapes, and droppings.\n2. **Face the right direction**: Set up your stand to face the direction deer are most likely to approach from. Consider the wind direction and try to position yourself downwind.\n3. **Elevate your stand**: Set up your stand at a comfortable height (15-25 feet) to get a better view of your surroundings and to avoid detection.\n4. **Conceal your stand**: Use natural camouflage like branches, leaves, and twigs to conceal your stand. Avoid setting up in areas with dense foliage, as it may obstruct your view.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Set up during the right time**: Set up your stand during the day, when deer are less active, to minimize disturbance.\n2. **Be mindful of the wind**: Avoid setting up in areas with strong winds, as they can make it difficult to stay quiet and comfortable.\n3. **Bring a first aid kit**: Always carry a first aid kit with you, in case of an emergency.\n4. **Let someone know your plan**: Inform someone about your hunting plan, including where you'll be setting up and when you plan to return.\n\nRegarding your guided duck hunting trip in January, that's great! Learning from an experienced guide can be incredibly valuable. Be sure to ask plenty of questions, take notes, and pay attention to their techniques and strategies.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines and regulations, and good luck on your hunts!"

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The San Joaquin River area offers some great deer hunting opportunities! When scouting for deer habitat near the San Joaquin River, look for areas with a mix of terrain and vegetation that provide deer with food, water, shelter, and escape routes. Here are some key features to focus on:\n\n**Terrain:**\n\n1. **River corridors**: The San Joaquin River and its tributaries create a network of corridors that deer use to travel, feed, and escape. Look for areas with dense vegetation, willows, and cottonwoods along the riverbanks.\n2. **Benchlands and terraces**: The gentle slopes and flat areas adjacent to the river, known as benchlands and terraces, can provide deer with habitat and feeding opportunities.\n3. **Hills and ridges**: Deer often use hills and ridges to escape harsh weather, predators, or hunting pressure. Look for areas with gentle to moderate slopes, as deer tend to avoid steep terrain.\n4. **Creek drainages**: Creeks and drainages flowing into the San Joaquin River can create habitat diversity and attract deer.\n\n**Habitat:**\n\n1. **Oak woodlands**: Mule deer thrive in oak woodlands, especially those with dense canopies and understory vegetation. Look for areas with blue oak, valley oak, or live oak trees.\n2. **Grasslands and meadows**: Deer feed on grasses, forbs, and shrubs in open areas. Look for meadows, grasslands, and agricultural fields, especially those with water sources nearby.\n3. **Brush and chaparral**: Deer use dense brush and chaparral for shelter and escape cover. Look for areas with thick stands of shrubs like chamise, ceanothus, or scrub oak.\n4. **Water sources**: Deer need access to water, so focus on areas with streams, creeks, springs, or ponds.\n\n**Other Features:**\n\n1. **Food sources**: Deer are attracted to areas with abundant food, such as agricultural fields, orchards, or areas with lush vegetation.\n2. **Edge habitat**: The transition zones between different habitats, like where forests meet grasslands, can be attractive to deer.\n3. **Topography**: Deer often use terrain features like saddles, draws, and benches to move through the landscape.\n4. **Sign and tracks**: Look for deer sign like tracks, scat, rubs, and scrapes to indicate deer activity in the area.\n\nWhen scouting, pay attention to the overall habitat diversity and how these features intersect. Deer tend to thrive in areas with a mix of food, water, shelter, and escape routes. Be sure to follow all regulations and respect private property when scouting.\n\nRemember to also consider the time of year, weather, and hunting pressure when planning your hunt. Good luck, and I hope you find some great spots!"

Here are some tips to help you increase your chances of spotting deer:\n\n**Reading Deer Sign:**\n\n1. **Look for fresh tracks**: Fresh tracks are a great indicator of recent deer activity. Pay attention to the size, shape, and direction of the tracks.\n2. **Identify deer trails**: Deer often use established trails, which can be identified by the frequency of tracks, rubbed trees, and scuffed leaves.\n3. **Rubbed trees and branches**: Bucks rub their antlers on trees to mark their territory. Look for rubbed trees, especially those with fresh sap or bark missing.\n4. **Scrapes and beds**: Deer create scrapes by pawing the ground and urinating on the spot. Beds are areas where deer rest, often marked by flattened vegetation.\n5. **Droppings and urine**: Deer droppings can indicate the presence of deer in the area. Fresh droppings are usually dark and moist, while older droppings are lighter and more brittle.\n6. **Browse lines**: Deer feed on vegetation, leaving behind browse lines (lines of clipped or nibbled plants).\n\n**Reading Deer Tracks:**\n\n1. **Track size and shape**: Deer tracks are typically 2-3 inches long and heart-shaped. Bucks tend to have larger tracks than does.\n2. **Track direction**: Deer often move in a specific direction, such as towards food sources or bedding areas.\n3. **Track pattern**: Deer tracks can indicate the animal's pace and behavior. For example, a slow, deliberate pace might indicate a deer is feeding or moving cautiously.\n4. **Straddle width**: The distance between the tracks can indicate the deer's size and speed.\n5. **Gait pattern**: Deer have different gait patterns, such as a walking gait or a bounding gait. A walking gait might indicate a deer is moving slowly and deliberately.\n\n**Tips for Hunting during the Full Moon:**\n\n1. **Be prepared for nocturnal behavior**: Deer may be more active at night during the full moon, so be prepared to hunt during early morning and late evening hours.\n2. **Focus on bedding areas**: Deer may be more active in bedding areas during the full moon, as they tend to rest during the day and move at night.\n3. **Watch for movement**: Deer may be more active during the full moon, so be prepared to spot movement and respond quickly.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Move slowly and quietly**: When hunting, move slowly and quietly to avoid spooking deer.\n2. **Use your senses**: Pay attention to your surroundings, including sights, sounds, and smells.\n3. **Stay patient and persistent**: Hunting can be a waiting game, so stay patient and persistent in your efforts.\n\nBy paying attention to deer sign and tracks, you can increase your chances of spotting deer during your hunt. Remember to stay focused, patient, and prepared, and you'll be well on your way to a successful hunt!"

Here are some common tools used for gear adjustment:\n\n1. **Allen wrenches**: You'll need a set of Allen wrenches (3, 4, 5, and 6 mm) to adjust the derailleurs and limit screws.\n2. **Torx wrench**: Some bikes use Torx bolts, so it's a good idea to have a Torx wrench (e.g., T25) on hand.\n3. **Cable tension gauge**: A cable tension gauge helps you adjust the cable tension to the correct specification.\n4. **Chain wear indicator**: A chain wear indicator helps you check the condition of your chain and determine when it needs to be replaced.\n5. **Gear adjustment tool**: Some gear systems, like Shimano's Ultegra or Dura-Ace, require a specific tool for adjusting the derailleurs. Check your bike's manual or the manufacturer's website to see if you need a specific tool.\n\n**Bike helmet fitting:**\n\nCongratulations on your new Specialized Vice helmet! Proper helmet fitting is crucial for safety and comfort. Here are some tips to help you fit your helmet correctly:\n\n1. **Measure your head**: Before you start adjusting the helmet, measure the circumference of your head using a flexible tape measure or a string. This will give you a baseline to work from.\n2. **Adjust the fit system**: The Specialized Vice helmet has a dial-fit system. Turn the dial clockwise to tighten and counterclockwise to loosen. Adjust the fit system to fit snugly around your head, with about 1-2 fingers' width between the helmet and your eyebrows.\n3. **Position the helmet**: Place the helmet level on your head, with the front edge about 1-2 cm above your eyebrows. The helmet should sit squarely on your head, not tilted back or forward.\n4. **Check the straps**: Adjust the straps so they form a \"V\" shape under your ears. The straps should be snug but not too tight.\n5. **Shake test**: Once you've adjusted the fit system and straps, shake your head gently from side to side and forward and backward. The helmet should stay in place without slipping or wobbling.\n6. **Wear it for a while**: Wear the helmet for a short ride or walk to ensure it's comfortable and doesn't cause any pressure points.\n\nRemember, a properly fitted helmet is essential for safety. If you're still unsure, visit a local bike shop for a professional fitting.\n\nI hope that helps!"

If you're still unsure, you can purchase a set of Allen wrenches or a multi-tool that covers the common sizes.\n\n**Mountain bike woes:**\n\nSorry to hear that your mountain bike's rear shock is still being repaired. Borrowing a friend's hardtail can be a good temporary solution, but I'm sure you're eager to get back on your own bike.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to consider using this opportunity to give your mountain bike a thorough cleaning and maintenance check. You could also use this time to upgrade or replace any components that might need attention.\n\nRemember to stay patient and communicate with the repair shop to get an update on the status of your rear shock repair. It'll be back on the trails in no time!\n\nNow, let's get back to your road bike's gears. Once you have the correct Allen wrenches, you can start adjusting those gears. If you're still unsure or uncomfortable with the process, consider taking your bike to a local bike shop for a professional tune-up."

        "content": "A laser sensor in a gaming mouse emits a laser beam which reflects from the surface below the mouse. The sensor then measures the movement of the laser beam and calculates the movement of the mouse. This method provides a higher precision movement detection and can track movements on almost any surface, including transparent or reflective surfaces.\n\nOn the other hand, an optical sensor works by using an LED light to track the movement of the mouse. The sensor takes pictures of the surface below the mouse at regular intervals and measures the difference between successive images to track movement. Optical sensors typically have lower sensitivity and can only work effectively on certain types of surfaces.\n\nIn summary, a laser sensor provides a higher precision movement detection and can work on almost any surface, whereas an optical sensor is less sensitive and can only work on certain surfaces."

When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": because I wanted to, I saw online that receive the honor the gift had dropped a certain shirt, and I wanted to see if they had it in there. And they did. It just was more than I wanted to spend for they had it and it was more than I wanted to spend for it. But so that's the last time I typically whenever I go to Pentagon City, which has a ton of sneaker resale shops, so I go check out stuff there. They have that stores in there, and I check off this stuff. So they have all the updated stuff, that it's a black owned store. But they carry brands like purple, you know, like cars like that, you know, they have all that stuff in there. It seems like they in index towards black owned businesses or Black Wall street wear stuff. But obviously some of that stuff is not owned by, you know, just purely black companies. So.\nYeah. So how do you feel when you buy from a black hole?\nI don't know if I have any specific feelings about it. I mean, I'm happy that I get it. I guess it depends. Okay. If if I'm waking up making a decision that I want to support a black business that day that sure I feel good about it. Otherwise, I'm just buying something that I like, in which case, I'm happy that I'm getting that thing, but I'm not really concerned about the fact that it's black owned. Now, when I bought this Brooklyn circus gap collaboration, like the hoodies and whatever, I was excited to get that, because I felt like it was supporting Brooklyn circus and it wasn't like $200 Like it's a you know, a hoodie that's under $100. So I think that was amazing to get some Brooklyn circus brand that was under $100. So, you know, I felt good about that. Because I was thought it was great. I wasn't spending all my money. But you know, like a lot of the I guess at this point, a lot of the brands that I like tend to be more expensive. Like the just naturally the, the sweat shirts or hoodies and all that stuff tends to be 150 and up just like naturally like wasn't his and hers in Chicago like, there are the you know, the Pierre moss joints, you know all that stuff it was it's expensive like that, okay? It's just a it's a hoodie and it's some of them are really nice, but some of them ain't worth 250 that they're charging for the hoodie in my opinion. But I also try to support my community. So every now and then I will drop $20 for a hoodie. So I was really excited to buy a Brooklyn circus branded hoodie. That was under 100.\nOkay, nice. Nice. So do you do talk about black owned street brands to your friends?\nYeah, yeah, we actually, I have a one group chat, particularly where we're often talking about clothing and apparel. Now I will say I tend to put probably put them up on a lot of these brands more than anybody else. Like for instance. You know, like NBA players, outfits have gotten very popular, right? Like you see those pictures of what they're wearing all the time now. So a lot of this stuff comes up in the group chat. But every now and then there'll be like some brand like Mozart, somebody be like me what the hell was like this pyre mosting, I'm like, oh, that's Pierre Moss, blah, blah. And so that comes, that happens a lot. So we have a lot of discussions about like black owned brands and supporting Black brands and stuff like that, like that, that that is something in one particular group check that I have that comes up quite often. It's the the dudes that I know who were the more fashionable and like to spend money on the things that they really liked. So I do talk about these black owned brands, whenever I can. Mostly just kind of comes up naturally, because the people I'm talking to are also interested, invested in, like, they'd like to close, it hits different and it hits better if it's black owned.\nOkay, okay. It's like a, like a, like a small group, you're like, like five to 10 or something like that, just"

But I have like these separate groups, like I have, like specific people that I talked to for different things. So there's, I mean, anytime there's, you know, 20 or 30 random groups of people that are being talked to about these things, whenever you have these conversations between all the group chat, some are the groups that people know about these things, other ones that people that are telling you put them up on stuff. Some are the people that are putting me up on stuff, you know, but there's, you know, what I also do every now and then I'll write about this stuff, too, right? When I have a when there's something that I really like, okay, you know, I will take an opportunity to spotlight or highlight. Like, for instance, it's not a streetwear brand, necessarily a black owned T Shirt Company, but I met the owner of the company is called Stupid stank. And actually, yes, so Brianna, so the, you know, I picked up one of the shirts from Nubian human, and I took a picture of it. And then she saw it, somebody pointed out to her that I had it on, she used she started using those pictures for her like, promo stuff. Anyway, so once I got I got a line on her, you know, I did a podcast episode with her is like to talk to her about her company, and how she does things, you know, so, so if I get an opportunity to amplify these things, typically, I will. You know, when when I like you like, um, you know, especially, especially the black owned brands, right, like, you know, I wrote an article about all of the black owned brand coach shoe collaborations that I own, you know, because I feel like that highlights the brand. And the black owned brands more so than it does the shoes like I'm a big fan of like Joe Fresh goods. And all of his new balance collaborations, like I have, not all of them but I have a substantial number of those but I've written about Joe Fresh goods and the campaign's that he's done, that are very black in nature, like the stuff that he did, or, you know, the conversations among us are the inside voices outside quote, all this stuff, like I've written about all of those things, because I like to amplify that stuff. It's not like he needs it, he has a huge following, but, you know, I feel like it's me doing my little part where I can to amplify, you know, black culture where where I can.\nOkay, cool, cool. And then I see that when when you're searching for brands, is it using your phone or computer? Is that a mixed or?\nThat's probably 90% My phone 10% My Computer,\nokay. Okay. So to shift a little bit on the technology front and a little more on the technology front. If you're creating playlists, right music playlists, what aspects of creating music playlists Do you enjoy? Oh,\nwas a couple of things. I like like most people who if you make playlists, you're always trying to create the perfect playlist. So I like putting in songs together and feeling like I literally put the perfect sequence of songs together, obviously feel and vibe like you know, like, I have a playlist for instance that I've been putting together that I call like PJ's keep up. Because it's all the songs my younger artists that my nieces and nephews just keep putting me up. All right, so I'm putting this together. But as I listen to these things, it introduces me to new artists and like, let me add this to it. Let me see if I can find it artists that work. So I like the discovery piece of it. Because, you know, there's I like how the algorithms that they have will send you in the direction on its own to find new new artists. So, you know, I enjoy trying to put together a perfect playlist, which, you know, I have not done yet."
