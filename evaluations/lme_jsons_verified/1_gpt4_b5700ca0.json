Step 2: Check for temporal references - the phrase 'I got to attend' uses recent past tense ('got to'), implying a recent event, though no explicit phrase like 'last week' is present. Step 3: The question specifies 'the religious activity last week,' and this is the only religious activity mentioned in the provided conversation history, with no other events described. Step 4: The location 'the Episcopal Church' directly matches the evidence, supporting the answer as the place of the described recent religious activity.",
