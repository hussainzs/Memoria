I'm not able to provide you with a list of items that are on sale at your local grocery store this week.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you plan your shopping trip:\n\n1. **Check the store's website**: Most grocery stores post their weekly ads and sales on their website. You can visit your local store's website and look for the \"Weekly Ad\" or \"Sales\" section to see what's on sale this week.\n2. **Sign up for the store's email newsletter**: Many stores offer exclusive deals and sales to their email subscribers. By signing up, you'll receive notifications about upcoming sales and promotions.\n3. **Use a grocery shopping app**: Apps like Flipp, Checkout 51, or RetailMeNot aggregate sales data from various stores and allow you to browse weekly ads and plan your shopping trip.\n4. **Check social media**: Follow your local grocery store on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, where they often post about sales and promotions.\n5. **Visit the store**: If you're unable to find the information online, you can visit the store and check their weekly ad or ask a store employee about the current sales.\n\nRemember to always plan your shopping trip according to your needs and dietary preferences, and happy shopping!",

Unfortunately, I don't have access to real-time sales data, so I can't tell you about specific deals on coffee beans or coffee makers at your local store.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general tips to help you find good deals on coffee beans and coffee makers:\n\n1. **Look for sales on coffee beans**: Many grocery stores offer discounts on coffee beans during certain times of the year or as part of their weekly sales. Keep an eye out for buy-one-get-one-free deals, percentage-off discounts, or bundle deals.\n2. **Check online retailers**: Online stores like Amazon, Walmart, or Target often have a wide selection of coffee beans and coffee makers at competitive prices. You can also check for deals, discounts, or coupons on these websites.\n3. **Consider buying in bulk**: If you drink coffee regularly, buying coffee beans in bulk can be a cost-effective option. Look for stores that offer discounts for bulk purchases or consider subscribing to a coffee bean delivery service.\n4. **Keep an eye on coffee maker sales**: If you're in the market for a new coffee maker, look for sales during holiday weekends, Black Friday, or Cyber Monday. You can also check for discounts on certified refurbished or open-box models.\n5. **Use cashback apps**: Cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), TopCashback, or Fetch Rewards offer rebates on certain purchases, including coffee beans and coffee makers.\n\nRemember to always check prices, read reviews, and consider your budget before making a purchase.\n\nI hope these tips help you find a great deal on coffee beans or a coffee maker!",
