        "content": "\"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" is an amazing book! I'm glad you're enjoying it!\n\nFitting reading into a busy schedule can be challenging, but with a few strategies, you can make it a priority. Here are some tips to help you squeeze in more reading time:\n\n1. **Schedule it in**: Treat reading as a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Set a specific time and duration for reading, and stick to it.\n2. **Start small**: You don't need to dedicate an hour or more to reading. Even 15-20 minutes a day can be beneficial. Begin with a manageable goal, and gradually increase the time as you make reading a habit.\n3. **Make it a habit loop**: Attach reading to an existing habit, like right before bed, during your daily commute, or while enjoying your morning coffee. This way, reading becomes an automatic part of your routine.\n4. **Choose the right format**: If you're short on time, consider audiobooks or e-books, which can be easily consumed during activities like exercising, cooking, or driving.\n5. **Prioritize your reading material**: Be intentional about what you read. Focus on books that truly interest you, and don't be afraid to DNF (did not finish) if a book isn't holding your attention.\n6. **Take advantage of waiting time**: Use waiting time, like waiting in line, at the doctor's office, or during breaks at work, to sneak in a few pages.\n7. **Get comfortable**: Create a cozy reading nook or find a comfortable spot where you can relax and focus on your book.\n8. **Make it a self-care activity**: View reading as a way to unwind and recharge. This mindset can help you prioritize reading as a necessary part of your daily routine.\n9. **Get accountability**: Join a book club, find a reading buddy, or participate in online reading challenges to stay motivated and inspired.\n10. **Be flexible**: Life can be unpredictable, and some days you might not be able to fit in your usual reading time. Don't stress; simply adjust your schedule and make up for it when you can.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a rhythm that works for you and your unique schedule. With a little creativity and commitment, you can make reading a consistent part of your daily routine.\n\nEnjoy the rest of \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"!",
