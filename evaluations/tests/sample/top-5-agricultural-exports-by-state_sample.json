            "This indicates Kansas has a notably higher share of Wheat—a bulk grain—while Iowa allocates more to livestock and processing co-products (soybean meal, distillers grains).",
            "Across 2019–2025, Kansas’s totals peak in 2022 and are driven primarily by Beef with grains (Wheat, Corn, Soybeans) as key contributors, consistent with its production base and export corridors to Mexico and East Asia.",
            "Therefore, relative to Iowa, Kansas appears more concentrated in bulk Wheat (and less in processed co-products), though Beef remains Kansas’s single largest export, moderating the 'grain-concentrated' description."

            "Conclusion": "Partly yes — Kansas’s export profile has a stronger emphasis on bulk Wheat than Iowa’s, while Iowa leans more into livestock and soybean co-products. However, Beef is Kansas’s largest category overall, so the grain concentration is most evident in Wheat rather than across the entire mix.",
