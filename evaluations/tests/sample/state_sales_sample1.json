Aggregate state rows to the national level by summing each sales measure by Year, then compute FAFH share as FAFH / Total for both nominal and constant (1988=100) dollars. Identify the earliest crossover year where the national share exceeds 50%, and report a concise 2015–2024 series to show the pre-pandemic level, the 2020 shock, and the subsequent recovery.

Evaluate whether the recovery after 2020 restores the >50% pattern and whether later years (2022–2024) exceed the pre-pandemic benchmark.

                "Rationale": "Both nominal and real shares remain above 50% for most years after 2014, and the latest values (2023–2024) are the highest in the series. This suggests a structural shift in U.S. food spending patterns toward dining out, beyond cyclical or inflation effects.",

            "National FAFH shares cross the 50% threshold in 2014 (nominal) and 2013 (real) and stay there for nearly all subsequent years, with a single-year interruption in 2020. By 2022, FAFH shares exceed 2019 levels in both nominal and real terms and climb further through 2024, indicating durability rather than a transient rebound.",
            "State rankings center on DC, HI, NV, NY, and MA, where service-centric economies and tourism intensify dining-out behavior. The persistence of these leaders across 2019 and 2024 supports the view that structural factors (urban density, tourism, labor markets) underpin the elevated FAFH shares."
        ],
        "output": {
            "Conclusion": "Yes — the data show a durable shift toward FAFH that resumed quickly after the 2020 shock, with 2022–2024 above pre-pandemic shares. DC, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, and Massachusetts are consistent exemplars of dining-out intensity.",
            "Implications": "Long-run menu pricing, restaurant capacity, and urban/tourism dynamics likely anchor these shares above the 50% mark. Policymakers and operators can expect FAFH to remain structurally elevated barring major exogenous shocks.",
