                "Context": "The magnitude and speed of the recovery imply normalization rather than a permanent shift toward at-home consumption. By 2022–2024, most states are above 2019 in real FAFH, signaling durable demand for food-away-from-home services.",

            "Real-dollar aggregates confirm a large decline in FAFH and a simultaneous increase in FAH in 2020, consistent with substitution. The national FAFH series surpasses 2019 by 2021 and continues higher through 2024, while state counts show a majority recovered by 2022 and nearly all by 2024.",

            "Analytic_Note": "Using constant-dollar series avoids attributing recovery to inflation; the rebound is evident in real terms and widespread geographically.",
