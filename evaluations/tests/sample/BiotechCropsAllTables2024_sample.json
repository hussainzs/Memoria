Iowa consistently exhibited higher percentages of insect-resistant (Bt) corn adoption than Illinois during the early 2000s, peaking in 2004 at 36% compared to Illinois' 26%. Both states saw declines after 2006 as stacked (multi-trait) varieties gained dominance, displacing single-trait Bt-only corn. From 2013 onward, both states remained in the low single digits, with Iowa slightly ahead in most years but following a parallel downward trend. This suggests both states transitioned away from Bt-only corn at roughly the same pace, reflecting a shift toward multi-trait hybrids that combine insect resistance with herbicide tolerance.",

                "Next: we need to align this with the rise of stacked (Bt + herbicide-tolerant) varieties. General U.S. data indicates that stacked-trait corn (Bt+HT) began growing significantly in the early 2000s and by 2013 had reached a large share. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",

                "Putting this together: Iowa’s fastest adoption growth for Bt‐only corn was in 2002. That corresponds to a period when Bt corn (possibly single‐trait) was still rising rapidly but before stacked traits became dominant. After 2004/2005, the adoption of single‐trait Bt only corn appears to decline (in Iowa data), likely because farmers shifted toward hybrids that combined both insect- and herbicide-tolerance (i.e., stacked traits).",

That alignment implies the transition from Bt‐only to stacked trait corn in Iowa around mid-2000s."

            "We have previously shown that in Iowa the percentage of corn acres planted to insect-resistant (Bt) only corn rose early (peaking around 2004 at ~36 %) and then declined steadily thereafter (dropping into the single digits by the 2010s).",
            "We also know from published national/state data that stacked‐trait varieties (those combining insect resistance + herbicide tolerance) have become the dominant technology in corn. For example, the 2024 Iowa report indicates 84 % of corn acres were planted with stacked gene varieties, only 4 % with insect-resistant only, and 7 % with herbicide-resistant only. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",
            "Thus the timing aligns: as stacked‐trait adoption ramped up in Iowa, the share of single‐trait Bt corn declined.",
            "While the dataset we used for single‐trait Bt corn shows decline post‐mid-2000s, the 84% stacked figure in 2024 shows stacked trait is now the overwhelming majority. This suggests a substitution effect: farmers moving from Bt only to stacked hybrids.",
            "Why might this shift happen? Several plausible explanations backed by literature: (a) Stacked hybrids provide broader pest/weed control—combining insect resistance + herbicide tolerance increases value to growers. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (b) Seed companies and trait providers marketed stacked hybrids heavily and they gained rapid adoption; the economics favoured packages. (c) Once single‐trait Bt corn reached near‐saturation and major insect pressures were managed, incremental benefit of Bt only may have diminished relative to stacked. (d) Regulatory/market incentives: as the research on stacked trait hybrids showed yield protection/reduced risk in drought/ pest contexts, farmers had incentive to upgrade. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} (e) Refuge and resistance management requirements might have changed how single‐trait BT hybrids were used, encouraging stacked gene use.",
            "Therefore, yes—the data suggest that the rise of stacked trait varieties in Iowa is strongly associated with (and likely caused) the decline in percentage of acres planted to single-trait insect‐resistant corn.",
            "Caveats: We don’t observe a direct year-by-year breakdown of stacked vs single‐trait in the Bt dataset, so strictly speaking we infer correlation rather than causal proof. But the alignment in timing and the magnitude of change make the inference robust."

            "conclusion": "Yes — the data for Iowa indicate that as stacked (insect + herbicide tolerant) corn varieties rose to dominance, the share of corn acres planted to single-trait insect-resistant (Bt only) corn declined.
