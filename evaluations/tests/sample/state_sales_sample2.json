            "In all three states, nominal increases (265–346%) far exceed real increases (70–110%), and nominal CAGRs are roughly double real CAGRs. This gap is stable across states and underscores the importance of adjusting for inflation when comparing long-run trends.",
            "Texas leads in real growth and real CAGR, followed by California and then New York. While the dataset does not include causal covariates, the ranking is consistent with broader patterns of population growth, income trends, and foodservice expansion across these states."
