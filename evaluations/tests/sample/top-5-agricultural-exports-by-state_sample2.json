From 2019→2021, China rises sharply (+13.6B in 2021 vs 2020) while ROW also grows (+2.72B), indicating expansion rather than pure substitution; by contrast, 2024 shows a large decline to China (−12.31B) alongside a smaller decline in ROW (−4.69B), suggesting broad softening rather than a shift toward other destinations.",

The 2024 pullback in China appears only partially offset by ROW, consistent with a broad export downshift rather than substitution toward other destinations.",

    "answer": {
        "reasoning_trace": [
            "The national series (state-summed) shows soybean exports to China rising from ~$10.0B in 2019 to ~$38.0B in 2023 before easing to ~$25.7B in 2024, indicating a strong multi-year expansion followed by a pullback. When scaled by total soybean exports (World), China’s share climbs from ~30% (2019) to ~59% (2023) and remains above ~54% in 2024, confirming increased concentration in China across most of the window.",
            "State-level composition in 2019 vs 2024 highlights Louisiana and Washington as persistent leaders, with their roles plausibly tied to export logistics (e.g., Gulf and Pacific port corridors) rather than agricultural production alone; Midwest producers still appear in the top contributors (Illinois, Ohio). This aligns with the known 'origin-of-movement' effect in state export accounting, where shipments are often attributed to the state where commodities enter the export supply chain.",
            "Finally, analyzing (World−China) indicates that 2020–2021 gains in China did not come at the expense of other destinations (ROW also expanded), while 2024’s declines were broad-based (China and ROW both fell). This pattern supports a narrative of demand cycles and logistics capacity influencing totals more than strict destination substitution within this period."
        ],
        "output": {
            "Conclusion": "Yes — between 2019 and 2023, U.S. soybean exports became markedly more concentrated in China, with a modest retracement in 2024 that still leaves China above half of total state-summed exports. The state-level distribution is best explained by export corridor logistics (Gulf and Pacific ports) combined with Midwest production flows, producing high contributions from port states alongside key producing states.",

                "Concentration trend evidenced by China’s share rising from ~30% (2019) to ~59% (2023), then moderating in 2024.",
                "Port-driven 'origin-of-movement' accounting that boosts Louisiana and Washington in state rankings.",
                "Concurrent movements in China and ROW suggest demand cycles and capacity constraints, not simple one-for-one destination substitution."
