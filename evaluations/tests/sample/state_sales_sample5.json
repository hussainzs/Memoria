            "Both Top-5 share and HHI rose from the late 1990s to 2024, with a higher post-2010 average, signaling gradual concentration gains. The shift is noticeable but not large enough to suggest oligopoly-like national dominance.",
            "California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois consistently anchor the Top-5, reflecting durable structural advantages. Sensitivity analyses excluding DC show the trend is not dependent on small outliers."

            "Conclusion": "FAFH has become modestly more geographically concentrated since the late 1990s, led by the largest population and service-sector states. The trend is steady rather than abrupt and remains broad-based overall.",
