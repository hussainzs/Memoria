Public transportation: Rostov has a network of buses, trams, and trolleybuses that connect different parts of the city. The public transportation system is efficient and affordable, and can be a good option for getting to attractions that are farther away from the center. 3. Taxis: Taxis are widely available in Rostov, and they can be a convenient and comfortable way to get around the city. You can either hail a taxi on the street or use one of the ride-hailing apps like Yandex.Taxi or Uber. 4. Guided tours: Many of Rostov's cultural attractions offer guided tours that are led by knowledgeable guides who can provide insights and information about the history, architecture, and art of the city. This can be a great way to see the sights and learn more about Rostov's cultural heritage. I hope this advice helps you get the most out of your visit to Rostov!"

        "content": "I'm glad I could help. As for the best time of year to visit Rostov, it really depends on your preferences and what you want to see and do. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Weather: Rostov has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The summer months (June-August) can be very hot, with temperatures regularly reaching 30°C and above, while the winter months (December-February) can be cold, with temperatures often dropping below freezing. Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) are generally mild and pleasant. 2. Festivals and events: Rostov has several annual festivals and events that are worth checking out. The Rostov Don Festival takes place in June and features music, dance, theater, and film performances from all over the world. The Rostov City Day celebration takes place in September and includes parades, concerts, and fireworks. 3. Crowds and peak season: The summer months (especially July and August) can be very busy in Rostov, as this is when many Russian tourists take their vacations. If you want to avoid the crowds, consider visiting in the off-season (October-April). 4. Sightseeing: Many of Rostov's cultural attractions are indoors (museums, theaters, etc. ), so the time of year you visit may not make a huge difference in terms of what you can see and do. However, if you want to explore the city's parks and gardens, visit in the spring or early summer when the weather is mild and the flowers are in bloom. I hope this helps you decide when to visit Rostov!"

This includes training the community members to identify and report poaching activities, and involving them in income-generating activities such as tourism.\n\n3. Creating wildlife conservancies: African countries are creating wildlife conservancies where animals have a safe haven to breed and live free from human encroachment.\n\n4. Economic incentives: African countries are using economic incentives to encourage people to conserve wildlife. They are paying people to protect wildlife, creating hunting quotas, and providing employment opportunities in the conservation sector.\n\n5. Awareness campaigns: African countries are raising awareness about the negative impact of poaching and illegal hunting by launching campaigns and educating communities about the negative effects of wildlife loss.\n\nOverall, African countries are making significant efforts to protect their wildlife from poaching and illegal hunting, and these measures are improving the conservation efforts in the region."

Organizing a small space requires some planning, but with the right strategies, you can maximize your space and make the most of it. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**1. Purge and declutter**: Before setting up your studio, get rid of any unnecessary items in the room. Donate, recycle, or repurpose anything that's not essential for your art practice.\n\n**2. Assess your needs**: Think about the types of art you'll be creating, the supplies you'll need, and how you'll be using the space. This will help you determine the layout and storage solutions that will work best for you.\n\n**3. Optimize your layout**:\n\t* Consider a U-shaped workstation or an L-shaped desk to maximize counter space and storage.\n\t* Place your easel or main work surface in a well-lit area, away from direct sunlight (which can cause colors to fade).\n\t* Leave enough space to move around comfortably and for any equipment, like a printing press or kiln.\n\n**4. Storage solutions**:\n\t* Invest in shelving units, bookcases, or storage cubes to keep supplies organized and out of the way.\n\t* Use stackable containers, bins, and baskets to store items like paints, brushes, canvases, and paper.\n\t* Utilize wall space with pegboards, hooks, or a bulletin board for hanging items like canvases, aprons, or inspirational images.\n\n**5. Categorize and group supplies**:\n\t* Organize supplies by category (e.g., paints, drawing materials, printmaking supplies).\n\t* Group similar items together (e.g., all your brushes in one container, all your paints in another).\n\t* Label each container or shelf to help you quickly find what you need.\n\n**6. Utilize vertical space**:\n\t* Install shelves or a pegboard on walls to store items like canvases, frames, or art books.\n\t* Use floor-to-ceiling storage units or bookcases to maximize storage capacity.\n\n**7. Consider a worktable with built-in storage**:\n\t* Look for a worktable with built-in drawers, shelves, or cabinets to keep supplies within easy reach.\n\t* You can also add a keyboard tray or a slide-out shelf for additional storage.\n\n**8. Add good lighting**:\n\t* Invest in a good task light or overhead lighting to illuminate your workspace.\n\t* Consider using LED lights, which are energy-efficient and produce minimal heat.\n\n**9. Create a comfortable workspace**:\n\t* Invest in a comfortable, ergonomic chair and a standing desk or riser, if needed.\n\t* Add a small fridge or a coffee maker to keep you fueled and focused.\n\n**10. Make it your own**:\n\t* Personalize your space with inspiring artwork, quotes, or plants.\n\t* Make sure the space feels comfortable and inviting, so you'll want to spend time creating in it.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a functional and inspiring small art studio in your spare bedroom.

Congratulations on completing four projects and feeling confident about your skills!\n\nVarnishing and protecting your painting is a crucial step to ensure it remains vibrant and protected for years to come. Here are some tips to help you varnish and protect your artwork:\n\n**Choose the right varnish**:\n\n* Look for a varnish specifically designed for artworks, such as dammar varnish, Liquitex Soluvar, or Golden MSA Varnish.\n* Consider a varnish with UV protection to prevent fading and discoloration.\n* Acrylic and oil paintings require different types of varnish, so make sure to choose the right one for your medium.\n\n**Prepare your painting**:\n\n* Make sure your painting is completely dry and cured. This can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the medium and thickness of the paint.\n* Gently dust the surface with a soft brush or cloth to remove any debris.\n* If necessary, lightly sand the surface to create a smooth finish.\n\n**Apply the varnish**:\n\n* Read the instructions on the varnish carefully and follow the recommended application guidelines.\n* Apply the varnish in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight.\n* Use a high-quality, soft-bristled brush or a foam brush to apply the varnish. Work in thin, even layers, starting from the top of the painting and working your way down.\n* Avoid applying too much varnish, as it can create a sticky or cloudy finish.\n\n**Tips for a smooth finish**:\n\n* Apply the varnish in thin layers, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.\n* Work in a consistent, even motion to avoid streaks or brushstrokes.\n* Use a gentle, sweeping motion to blend the varnish into the painting.\n* Avoid applying varnish to the edges of the canvas or board, as it can seep behind the painting and cause problems.\n\n**Protecting your painting**:\n\n* Once the varnish is fully dry, consider adding a layer of protection, such as a UV-resistant acrylic coating or a museum-quality glass or acrylic glazing.\n* Handle your painting with care, avoiding touching the surface or exposing it to extreme temperatures, humidity, or direct sunlight.\n* Consider framing your painting with acid-free materials and UV-filtering glass to further protect it from environmental factors.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to protect your beautiful sunset painting and ensure it remains a treasured piece of art for years to come. Good luck, and I hope your sister loves the finished piece!",

Here are some tips on how to sign and date your painting without detracting from the overall piece:\n\n**Choose a discreet location**:\n\n* Sign your painting in a corner, usually the lower right or left, where it won't distract from the main composition.\n* Avoid signing in the center of the painting or on top of important elements, as it can disrupt the visual balance.\n\n**Select a harmonious font**:\n\n* Choose a font that complements the style and theme of your painting. For example, a modern, sans-serif font might work well for a contemporary piece, while a serif font could suit a more traditional or classical work.\n* Ensure the font is legible and not too ornate, as it might draw attention away from the artwork.\n\n**Use a consistent signature**:\n\n* Develop a consistent signature style that you use for all your artworks. This will help establish your artistic identity and make it easier for collectors and galleries to recognize your work.\n* Consider creating a monogram or logo that represents your artistic brand.\n\n**Date your painting**:\n\n* Include the year you completed the painting, not the year you started it. This ensures that the date reflects the final version of the artwork.\n* You can also include the month or day, if you prefer, but the year is the most important.\n\n**Signing and dating mediums**:\n\n* For oil or acrylic paintings, use a paintbrush to sign and date the piece in a color that complements the artwork.\n* For mixed media or collage pieces, you can use a variety of materials, such as ink, marker, or even fabric.\n* For digital artworks, you can add a digital signature and date to the file or print.\n\n**Tips for avoiding distractions**:\n\n* Keep your signature and date small and unobtrusive, so they don't compete with the main composition.\n* Avoid using bright or bold colors that might draw attention away from the artwork.\n* Consider adding a slight fade or subtle blending to integrate your signature and date into the painting.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively sign and date your painting without detracting from the overall piece. Remember, the goal is to provide a subtle yet professional touch that adds to the artwork's authenticity and value.",

I'm happy to help you troubleshoot what's going on with your beloved plant.\n\nDroopy leaves can be caused by a variety of factors, including overwatering, underwatering, or even environmental conditions. Let's go through some questions to help narrow down the issue:\n\n1. **Watering schedule:** How often are you watering Freddy, and how much water are you giving him each time? Are you checking the soil moisture before watering?\n2. **Soil moisture:** When you stick your finger into the soil, does it feel dry to the touch, or is it damp/moist? Are you noticing any water pooling around the base of the plant?\n3. **Potting mix:** What type of potting mix is Freddy planted in? Is it well-draining, or could it be retaining too much water?\n4. **Light and temperature:** How much direct sunlight is Freddy getting, and what's the temperature range in the room? Fiddle leaf figs prefer bright, indirect light and temperatures between 65°F to 75°F (18°C to 24°C).\n5. **Humidity:** Is the air in the room relatively dry, or is it humid? Fiddle leaf figs prefer a humid environment, but they can adapt to average humidity levels.\n6. **Fertilization:** Are you fertilizing Freddy regularly? Fiddle leaf figs benefit from regular feeding, especially during the growing season (spring and summer).\n7. **Pests:** Have you noticed any pests, like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale, on Freddy's leaves or stems?\n8. **Pruning:** Have you been pruning Freddy regularly to maintain his shape and encourage new growth?\n\nAs for Samantha the snake plant, congratulations on successfully propagating new plants and sharing one with your sister! Snake plants are indeed low-maintenance and easy to care for.\n\nOnce you provide more information about Freddy's care, I'll do my best to help you identify the cause of his droopy leaves and offer guidance on how to get him back to his happy, healthy self."

Freddy gets direct sunlight for about 2-3 hours in the morning, and the room temperature is usually around 70-72°F (21-22°C). I haven't been fertilizing him regularly, but I did fertilize him once a month ago. I haven't noticed any pests on him. I haven't pruned him yet, but I'm planning to soon. By the way, I'm also curious about how often I should water my peace lily, Lily, which is on a tray with pebbles and water. Should I water it more often since it's on the tray?"

        "content": "Thank you for providing more information about Freddy's care.\n\nBased on what you've shared, here are some potential issues that might be contributing to Freddy's droopy leaves:\n\n1. **Overwatering:** Watering every other day might be too frequent, especially if you're not checking the soil moisture beforehand. Fiddle leaf figs prefer to dry out slightly between waterings. I recommend checking the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait another day or two before watering again.\n2. **Poor drainage:** If the general-purpose potting mix isn't well-draining, it could be retaining too much water, leading to root rot and droopy leaves. Consider repotting Freddy in a well-draining mix specifically designed for indoor plants.\n3. **Insufficient fertilization:** While you did fertilize Freddy a month ago, fiddle leaf figs benefit from regular feeding, especially during the growing season. Consider fertilizing him every 2-3 weeks during spring and summer with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.\n\nTo address these issues, I recommend the following:\n\n* Start checking the soil moisture before watering, and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\n* Consider repotting Freddy in a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* Fertilize Freddy every 2-3 weeks during the growing season to provide him with the necessary nutrients.\n\nNow, about Lily the peace lily:\n\n* **Watering frequency:** Since Lily is on a tray with pebbles and water, you don't need to water her more frequently. In fact, this setup can help with humidity and reduce the need for frequent watering. Check the soil moisture as you would with Freddy, and water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry.\n* **Watering technique:** When you do water Lily, make sure to water her thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain out of the pot. This will help prevent waterlogged soil and root rot.\n* **Humidity:** The pebble tray can help maintain a humid environment, which peace lilies prefer. However, if your home is particularly dry, you might consider misting Lily's leaves occasionally to maintain a humid microclimate.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you should start to see improvements in both Freddy and Lily's health. Remember to monitor their progress, and adjust your care routine as needed."

Here are some recommendations for pots that are perfect for herbs like basil:\n\n1. **Terracotta pots:** Terracotta pots are an excellent choice for herbs like basil. They're breathable, allowing for good air circulation and moisture evaporation, which helps prevent root rot. Look for ones with drainage holes in the bottom to ensure excess water can escape.\n2. **Ceramic pots:** Ceramic pots are another great option for basil. They're often more decorative than terracotta pots and can add a touch of elegance to your kitchen or garden. Make sure they have drainage holes or a built-in water reservoir to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Self-watering pots:** Self-watering pots are a fantastic choice for herbs like basil, especially if you tend to forget to water them (we've all been there!). These pots have a built-in water reservoir that allows the plant to draw water as needed, reducing the risk of overwatering.\n4. **Hanging baskets:** If you want to add a charming touch to your kitchen or patio, consider a hanging basket for Basilica. Hanging baskets allow for good air circulation and can help keep pests away.\n\nWhen choosing a pot for Basilica, keep the following in mind:\n\n* **Size:** Basil plants can grow quite large, so choose a pot that's at least 6-8 inches deep and 8-12 inches wide to give her room to spread out.\n* **Material:** As mentioned earlier, terracotta, ceramic, or self-watering pots are great options. Avoid plastic pots, as they can retain too much water and cause root rot.\n* **Drainage:** Make sure the pot has drainage holes or a built-in water reservoir to prevent waterlogged soil.\n\nSome popular brands for herb pots include:\n\n* **Lechuza:** Known for their high-quality, self-watering pots that are perfect for herbs like basil.\n* **Umbra:** Offers a wide range of stylish, modern pots that are suitable for herbs.\n* **Ceramic pots from Etsy sellers:** If you're looking for unique, handmade pots, consider shopping on Etsy.

And what a lovely gesture to share one with your sister!\n\nFor Charlotte's new pot, spider plants prefer pots that provide good drainage, aeration, and are well-suited for their trailing growth habit. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Hanging baskets:** Spider plants look stunning in hanging baskets, which allow their long stems and babies to cascade beautifully. Choose a basket with a sturdy chain or rope and a diameter of at least 12-14 inches to give Charlotte room to spread out.\n2. **Trailing planters:** Look for planters with a wide mouth and a shallow depth, which will encourage Charlotte's stems to trail down. These planters are often designed specifically for trailing plants like spider plants.\n3. **Pots with good drainage:** Spider plants don't like wet feet, so a pot with excellent drainage is essential. Opt for pots with multiple drainage holes in the bottom or a built-in drainage system.\n4. **Shallow pots:** Spider plants have a shallow root system, so they don't need a deep pot. A pot with a depth of 6-8 inches is sufficient.\n\nWhen choosing a pot for Charlotte, consider the following:\n\n* **Material:** Spider plants can thrive in pots made from a variety of materials, including ceramic, terracotta, or plastic. However, make sure the pot has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* **Size:** As mentioned earlier, choose a pot that's at least 12-14 inches in diameter to give Charlotte room to spread out.\n* **Color:** Spider plants have beautiful, delicate foliage, so a pot with a subtle color or pattern will allow them to be the focal point.\n\nSome popular brands for spider plant pots include:\n\n* **Macramé hangers:** If you want to add a bohemian touch to your space, consider a macramé hanger with a pot attached. These are perfect for spider plants and add a unique decorative element.\n* **Ceramic pots from West Elm:** West Elm offers a range of stylish, modern ceramic pots that are perfect for spider plants.\n* **Plastic pots from Gardeneer:** Gardeneer offers a variety of plastic pots with good drainage and aeration, making them suitable for spider plants.\n\nRemember to handle Charlotte gently during the repotting process, and make sure to provide her with bright, indirect light and regular watering.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear you're sharing your plant love with your sister again!"

Here are some tips to help Lily stay happy and healthy during the winter months:\n\n1. **Reduce watering:** Peace lilies require less water during the winter months when they're dormant. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry to the touch, and reduce the frequency of watering to once every 4-6 weeks.\n2. **Lower temperatures:** Peace lilies prefer temperatures between 65°F to 75°F (18°C to 24°C) during the winter. If your home gets colder, consider moving Lily to a warmer spot or using a space heater to maintain a comfortable temperature.\n3. **Humidity:** Peace lilies love humidity, but during the winter, the air can be drier due to central heating. To combat this, place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby to maintain a humid microclimate.\n4. **Less fertilizer:** Peace lilies don't require as much fertilizer during the winter months. You can skip fertilizing Lily until spring, when she'll start to produce new growth again.\n5. **Prune dead leaves:** Remove any dead or dying leaves from Lily to prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth. Use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears to avoid spreading bacteria.\n6. **Monitor for pests:** Check Lily regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale, which can be more prevalent during the winter months. If you notice any, treat her with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n7. **Provide bright, indirect light:** While peace lilies can tolerate low light, they still need some bright, indirect light to photosynthesize. Move Lily to a spot with bright, indirect light, but avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll help Lily stay happy and healthy during the winter months. Remember to monitor her condition and adjust your care routine as needed.\n\nI'm sure your sister will appreciate the new spider plant baby, and with your guidance, she'll be well on her way to becoming a successful plant parent!"

        "content": "That sounds like an fascinating direction! Blending acoustic and electronic elements can lead to some amazing, genre-bending sounds. Indie folk and singer-songwriter music often have a strong focus on storytelling and emotional depth, while ambient and experimental electronic music can add a layer of atmosphere and texture. Combining these elements can create a rich, captivating sound.\n\nTo get started, you might consider the following:\n\n**Acoustic elements:**\n\n* Focus on recording high-quality acoustic guitar tracks, using techniques like double-tracking, layering, and creative mic placement to create a warm, intimate sound.\n* Experiment with other acoustic instruments like piano, ukulele, or even found objects (e.g., glass bottles, metal pipes) to add unique timbres.\n* Consider incorporating live percussion, such as drums or hand percussion, to add energy and dynamics.\n\n**Electronic elements:**\n\n* Start with ambient pads and textures to create a sonic backdrop for your acoustic elements. You can use virtual instruments or experiment with field recordings and found sounds.\n* Use synthesizers or virtual instruments to add melodic interest, such as subtle leads or atmospheric soundscapes.\n* Experiment with creative effects processing, like reverb, delay, and distortion, to enhance your electronic elements and create a sense of space.\n\n**Blending the two:**\n\n* Try using electronic elements to augment your acoustic tracks, such as adding subtle ambiance or subtle rhythmic elements to enhance the feel.\n* Experiment with processing your acoustic tracks through electronic effects, like running your guitar through a distortion pedal or using a vocoder on your vocals.\n* Use automation to create dynamic shifts between your acoustic and electronic elements, creating a sense of tension and release.\n\nSome great references to check out for inspiration:\n\n* Bon Iver: Known for blending folk and electronic elements, with a strong focus on atmosphere and texture.\n* James Blake: A singer-songwriter who often incorporates electronic elements, like synthesizers and drum machines, into his music.\n* Fleet Foxes: An indie folk band that often uses electronic elements, like ambient pads and subtle effects, to enhance their sound.\n* Four Tet: An electronic musician who often incorporates acoustic elements, like guitar and piano, into his productions.\n\nDAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, and FL Studio are all well-suited for blending acoustic and electronic elements. You can use their built-in instruments and effects to create a wide range of sounds, and experiment with different workflows to find what works best for you.\n\nWhat do you think about starting with a simple project, like creating a soundscape or atmospheric track that combines acoustic and electronic elements? This could be a great way to get started and experiment with different techniques."

        "content": "Creating a soundscape or atmospheric track is a great way to explore the possibilities of blending acoustic and electronic elements.\n\nFor this type of project, I'd recommend starting with a more free-form approach, allowing yourself to experiment and see where the music takes you. Don't worry too much about tempo or time signature at the beginning. Instead, focus on creating a mood or atmosphere that resonates with you.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. **Start with a guitar foundation**: Record a simple guitar part that evokes the mood or atmosphere you're aiming for. This could be a repeating pattern, a simple chord progression, or even just a series of ambient, atmospheric chords.\n2. **Experiment with electronic elements**: Add electronic elements to enhance the sound, such as:\n\t* Ambient pads or textures to create a sense of space and atmosphere.\n\t* Field recordings or found sounds to add interest and depth.\n\t* Synthesizers or virtual instruments to create melodic interest or add subtle rhythmic elements.\n3. **Play with effects and processing**: Use effects and processing techniques to shape and mold your sounds. This could include reverb, delay, distortion, or other creative effects to create a sense of distance, width, or depth.\n4. **Let the music guide you**: As you add more elements, pay attention to how the music is evolving. Let your instincts guide you, and make adjustments as needed to maintain the atmosphere and mood you're aiming for.\n\nTempo and time signature can emerge organically as you work on the track. You might find that your guitar part has a natural pulse or rhythm that suggests a certain tempo, or you might intentionally create a more ambient, atmospheric sound that defies traditional tempo and time signature constraints.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Keep it simple**: Don't feel like you need to add a million elements to create a compelling soundscape. Sometimes, less is more, and a few well-chosen elements can create a powerful atmosphere.\n* **Experiment and iterate**: Don't be afraid to try new things and make mistakes. This is a process of discovery, and you might stumble upon something amazing by accident.\n* **Use reference tracks**: Listen to tracks that inspire you and pay attention to how they create atmosphere and mood. Use these as reference points to guide your own creative decisions.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a soundscape that resonates with you, so don't worry too much about \"getting it right\" or following traditional rules. Just have fun and see where the music takes you!\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to start experimenting and creating?"

It's a spy thriller with a strong focus on action, suspense, and intrigue. The story jumps between two timelines, and the chapters are shorter and more concise.

However, it's not uncommon to find books that are longer, sometimes exceeding 600-800 pages.\n\nIn recent years, there's been a trend towards longer books in the historical fiction genre, possibly due to the complexity of the stories being told and the level of research involved. Authors like Hilary Mantel, Ken Follett, and Philippa Gregory are known for their detailed and immersive storytelling, which can result in longer page counts.\n\nThat being said, some historical fiction novels can be more concise, ranging from 250-350 pages. These books might focus on a specific event, time period, or character's story, allowing for a more streamlined narrative.\n\nIn the case of **The Alice Network**, the page count is around 432 pages in the hardcover edition, which is fairly typical for a historical fiction novel. **The Women in the Castle** has a slightly longer page count, around 512 pages in the hardcover edition.\n\nUltimately, the page count shouldn't deter you from reading a book.

Curse is one of our solution engineers here as well. Lizzy. So. We can with curtain when Natan comes on as well, we can jump in or we can hold on for another couple of minutes. That's totally up to you, but we can start diving into some of the detail in specifically around. The consumption piece. I know that's an element to the business, but we can keep it pretty fluid as well. And if there's anything top of mind that you want to cover. Yeah. Do field questions, Curtis. Certainly the brains behind the operation here. So. You're well supported.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 05:12\nWhat I didn't see the last time, but I'm sure it's on clarity is like a Kp. dashboard. You know, apart from the Salesforce. That's. Then it's fantastic. There's also the Kpi dashboards that is currently. Managed manually. You know, in excel and with formulas. And then, of course, we recently converted those to Power Bi. But. Does clarity have. A version also that showcases. Like a scope of a comparative performance. Chart showing. Kpis. Kpi. Performance. Between each sales rep and then rolled up to the sales leader. There's something like that. On Clari.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 06:05\nSo. We can I suppose the short answer is yes, but requires a caveat that we would just need to understand specifically what it is that you're referring to. I think one thing that would be really helpful as well. At some point we can get a mutual mda in places, but just to get some visibility over the kpis that you're tracking and how you're visualizing that in excel. And in Power bi and we can see if it's that we can put together in a dashboard. I'm not sure karate have there's any additional context that you would kind of add there.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 06:38\nI think you nailed it. I mean, it's just about understanding what kpis are tracked. And there's probably several different ways we can support that. And Clari. The forecast module comes to mind where because you mentioned roll up. Right. So it's just understanding what formulas that you're using today, in which metrics that you're interested in tracking and then. Most of our customers, what they do is they'll have. Steven, I'm sure you let them know that in clarity you're not limited to one view of the forecast. So let's just say you have your sales global sales forecast in clarity. You could have a separate Kpi dashboard or Kpi based roll up where it's less about. Okay, well, what's the commit and upside, right?\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:24\nIt's more about here's the here of the sales reps and the frontline manager.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:28\nAnd maybe we're tracking asp's sales cycle link thing like things like that and rolling that.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:36\nYou all of that. Yep. That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:39\nCool. I need to. Hey, guys.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:42\nHey, Stephen. Hey, cut. Sorry I got tied up on a on another call, which is actually about this. Let's get.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:51\nNo worries at all have you been. Yeah.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:53\nVery good. Thanks. Very good. How about yourself? Yeah. Keep them.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:56\nWell, thank you. Keep them well. I just thought I'd mention as well. I'm not sure if you saw the email came through, but I put together just an intro for yourself and Johnny from compliance. He just shared his calendar there. They've been a customer for a few years. By the way, similar stack to you. They use kaia and Outreach for top of funnel as well. They do.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:20\nInteresting. They they do use kaya.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:22\nYeah. I think they use Outreach for tapa funnel. And for kaya, they might even use it for more. But I think that's it and then Clarity for kind of forecasting, pipeline management, things like that. But Johnny is very familiar with the Clarity platform, so definitely a good person to speak to.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:38\nSure. Yeah. I'll try and connect with him this week. I saw you share this calendar there, so hopefully get a chance to sync up.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\""

Working with Animals: The film featured several animal actors, including wolves and bears, which come with inherent risks. The crew had to take extra precautions to ensure the safety of both animals and actors during filming.\n\n4. Long Hours: The process of creating a feature film is inherently long and arduous. \"The Revenant\" was no exception, and many cast and crew members worked long hours in challenging conditions to bring the project to completion.\n\nTo manage these challenges, the cast and crew had to work closely together and adapt to changing conditions. For example, they used special effects to create realistic animal scenes and employed safety measures to ensure that everyone was protected from the elements and the animals on set. The director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, was also known for his meticulous attention to detail, which helped ensure that the final product was of the highest quality."

One way is to focus on providing high-quality services and building a strong reputation within the community. This can help to attract more clients and improve customer loyalty, which can lead to increased income.\n\nAnother way to increase income is to diversify the services offered by the clinic. In addition to providing basic veterinary services, clinics can also offer specialized services such as dentistry, surgery, and nutrition counseling. This can help to attract clients who are seeking these specific services and are willing to pay a premium for them.\n\nClinics can also increase their income by partnering with local organizations, such as animal welfare groups and pet supply companies. These partnerships can provide opportunities for cross-promotion and referral business, which can help to increase the clinic's client base.\n\nFinally, clinics can improve their profitability by implementing efficient business practices and managing their finances carefully. This can include things like carefully tracking expenses and income, negotiating favorable rates with suppliers, and looking for ways to reduce overhead costs. By taking a proactive and strategic approach to managing their finances, clinics can increase their profitability and sustain their long-term success."

Since you've ruled out software-related issues, it's possible that the problem lies with the battery itself.\n\nThe fact that you've recently started using new accessories, such as a wireless mouse and portable charger, might be worth investigating further. Here are a few potential connections to consider:\n\n1. **Power consumption:** The new wireless mouse and portable charger might be drawing more power from your laptop than you expect. Check the power consumption of these devices to see if they're contributing to the battery drain.\n2. **Interference:** Wireless devices can sometimes interfere with your laptop's power management system, affecting battery life. Try disconnecting the wireless mouse and portable charger to see if the issue persists.\n3. **Charging patterns:** If you're using the portable charger to top up your laptop's battery, it might be affecting the battery's calibration. Try charging your laptop using the original charger to see if the issue persists.\n\nBefore replacing the battery, you might want to try a few more troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Calibrate your battery:** Let your battery drain to 0% and then charge it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to see if it helps improve battery life.\n2. **Check for battery wear:** Use built-in tools like Windows' Battery Report (Windows key + X > Device Manager > Batteries > Battery Report) or third-party software like Coconut Battery (for Mac) to check your battery's health and cycle count.\n3. **Inspect your battery:** Visually inspect your battery for signs of swelling, damage, or wear. If you find any issues, it might be a sign that the battery is indeed the problem.\n\nIf none of these steps help, it's possible that the battery is indeed the culprit, and replacing it might be the best course of action.\n\nRemember to consult your laptop's user manual or manufacturer's support resources for guidance on replacing the battery, as the process can vary depending on your laptop model.\n\nI hope this helps you troubleshoot the issue!"

Once you've replaced the battery, you can reassess the situation and see if the new battery resolves the issue.\n\nHere's why I suggest prioritizing the battery replacement:\n\n1. **Battery life is a critical issue:** A laptop's battery life is a fundamental aspect of its functionality. If your battery is no longer holding a charge, it can significantly impact your productivity and mobility.\n2. **RAM upgrade might not affect battery life:** While adding more RAM can improve your laptop's performance, it won't necessarily impact battery life. Replacing the battery will give you a better understanding of whether the issue is resolved or if other factors are contributing to the problem.\n3. **Easier to isolate issues:** By addressing the battery replacement first, you'll be able to isolate any potential issues with the new battery and rule out any other factors that might be affecting battery life.\n\nOnce you've replaced the battery and confirmed that it's resolved the issue (or not), you can then focus on upgrading your RAM. This will help you determine if the RAM upgrade has any impact on your laptop's performance and battery life.\n\nRemember to monitor your laptop's performance and battery life after replacing the battery and upgrading the RAM. This will help you identify any potential issues or areas for further improvement.\n\nHow does that sound?"

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you properly back up your files:\n\n1. **Connect your external hard drive:** Plug in your external hard drive to your laptop using the appropriate cable (usually USB).\n2. **Identify the files you want to back up:** Think about what files you want to back up. This might include documents, pictures, videos, music, and other important data. You can also consider backing up your desktop, documents, and downloads folders, as well as any specific files or folders you've created.\n3. **Use the correct backup method:** You can either use a backup software or do a manual copy-paste. If you're using a backup software, make sure it's compatible with your external hard drive and follow the software's instructions.\n\nFor a manual backup:\n\na. Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and navigate to the files or folders you want to back up.\nb. Select all the files and folders you want to back up by pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).\nc. Right-click on the selected files and choose \"Copy\" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C on Windows or Command+C on Mac).\nd. Navigate to your external hard drive in File Explorer or Finder and create a new folder for your backup (e.g., \"Laptop Backup\").\ne. Right-click inside the new folder and choose \"Paste\" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V on Windows or Command+V on Mac).\n\n4. **Verify your backup:** Once the backup process is complete, double-check that all your files have been successfully transferred to the external hard drive. You can do this by comparing the file sizes, dates, and contents to ensure everything is correct.\n5. **Store your external hard drive safely:** Keep your external hard drive in a safe place, away from physical damage, moisture, and extreme temperatures.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Use the 3-2-1 backup rule:** Have at least three copies of your important files, store them on two different types of media (e.g., external hard drive and cloud storage), and keep one copy offsite (e.g., in a different location).\n* **Set up regular backups:** Consider setting up a regular backup schedule to ensure your files are up-to-date and protected.\n* **Use encryption:** If you're storing sensitive data, consider using encryption to protect your files from unauthorized access.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a complete backup of your files on your external hard drive, and you can rest assured that your data is safe before replacing your laptop's battery.\n\nDo you have any other questions about backing up your files?"

This insight has allowed us to classify other stars based on their location on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which is a tool used to represent the relationship between a star's luminosity and temperature.\n\nAdditionally, studying the Sun has helped us understand the processes that occur within stars, including nuclear fusion, which is the energy source that powers stars. By studying the Sun's spectrum, we have been able to identify the elements present within it, which has helped us understand the composition of other stars.\n\nOverall, studying the Sun has been critical in our understanding of how stars work and how we can classify them based on their properties."

Ultra-hot Jupiters: Astronomers have recently discovered a new class of exoplanets known as \"ultra-hot Jupiters\". These planets are so close to their host stars that they have temperatures of over 1,700°C (3,100°F), making them hotter than some stars. Studying these planets and their host stars is expanding our knowledge of stellar classification and planetary formation.\n\n2. Multiple-star systems: Researchers have recently been studying multiple-star systems, particularly those with three or more stars in orbit around one another. These systems are important for studying gravitational interactions and how planets can form in such complex systems.\n\n3. Tidal disruption events: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star gets too close to a black hole and is ripped apart by the black hole's tidal forces. Studying these events can provide important information about the properties of the star and the black hole, and how they interact with each other.\n\n4. Brown dwarfs: Brown dwarfs are objects that are too small to be classified as stars and too big to be classified as planets. Recent research has focused on studying the properties of these objects in order to better understand the formation and evolution of stars and other celestial bodies.\n\nOverall, these are just a few of the many exciting discoveries being made in the field of stellar classification, and there are sure to be many more in the future as our technology and understanding continues to advance."

        "content": "Yes, there have been many recent discoveries in the classification of massive stars, which are stars that have a mass more than eight times that of the Sun.\n\nOne recent discovery is that many massive stars have strong magnetic fields. This was a surprising finding because it was thought that such strong magnetic fields were only present in smaller stars like the Sun. These strong magnetic fields can affect the evolution of massive stars and their interaction with their environment, so understanding them is an important consideration in stellar classification.\n\nAnother recent discovery is that massive stars can undergo complex eruptions that release both matter and energy. These eruptions can have an impact on the star's environment and can affect its evolution, so studying these events is also important for our overall understanding of massive stars.\n\nResearchers have also found that many massive stars rotate very quickly, which can affect their evolution by changing the way that they undergo fusion and eventually die. Understanding the rotation of massive stars is an important factor in classification.\n\nFinally, researchers are also studying the properties of highly energetic supernovae, which are explosions that occur when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse. By studying these events, researchers hope to better understand the properties of massive stars and how they evolve over time.\n\nOverall, these recent discoveries highlight the diverse and complex nature of massive stars and the importance of studying them in more detail."

        "content": "The properties of massive stars can have a significant impact on the universe at large. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Chemical enrichment: Massive stars are responsible for the creation of heavy elements in the universe through the process of nuclear fusion. When these stars eventually die in supernova explosions, they release these elements into the interstellar medium, where they can form new stars and planets. Without the contribution of massive stars, the universe would have a much lower abundance of heavy elements, including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron.\n\n2. Stellar winds: Massive stars have very strong stellar winds that can blow out material from their surroundings. These stellar winds can have a significant impact on the evolution of their host galaxies by altering the abundance of various elements and initiating the formation of new stars.\n\n3. Gamma-ray bursts: One of the most energetic events in the universe, gamma-ray bursts are caused by the collapse of massive stars into black holes. These events release vast amounts of energy and can be detected from across the universe. Studying these events can provide important insights into the properties of massive stars and black holes.\n\n4. Black hole formation: Massive stars are thought to be the progenitors of many of the black holes that we observe in the universe. By studying massive stars and their evolution, researchers can better understand the connection between these stars and the formation of black holes.\n\nOverall, the properties of massive stars have a significant impact on the universe at large, from the creation of heavy elements to the formation of black holes. Understanding these stars and their evolution is therefore essential to our understanding of the universe as a whole."

For example, there is ongoing debate about the exact process by which massive stars lose mass, which can have a significant impact on their ultimate fate.\n\n2. Internal mixing: Massive stars are known for having strong internal mixing, in which material from the core is brought to the surface. However, we don't fully understand the details of this mixing process, which can have implications for the star's evolution and its eventual fate.\n\n3. Supernova explosions: While we have a good understanding of the basic physics behind supernova explosions, there are still many unanswered questions about the details of these events, including how the shockwave from the explosion propagates through the star and what factors determine the final outcome.\n\n4. Binary interaction: Many massive stars are part of binary systems, in which they interact with other stars. These interactions can have a significant impact on the evolution of both stars, but we don't fully understand the specifics of these interactions.\n\nOverall, there is still much to be learned about the nature of massive stars, and ongoing research in this field will likely continue to yield new insights and discoveries."

It takes courage to acknowledge when your beliefs no longer align with your values and to seek a new path. Here are some advice and reflections to help you navigate this transition and find a spiritual practice that truly resonates with you:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to explore and question**: It's essential to give yourself permission to explore different spiritual practices and question what you've been taught. This process might feel uncomfortable, but it's a crucial step in discovering what truly resonates with you.\n2. **Identify your core values and intentions**: Reflect on what matters most to you in life, such as compassion, gratitude, or personal growth. What are your non-negotiables? What kind of spiritual practice aligns with these values? This will help you find a practice that honors your deepest aspirations.\n3. **Let go of guilt and shame**: You might feel guilty for leaving a religious tradition or practicing something that doesn't align with your upbringing. Remember that your spiritual journey is yours alone, and it's okay to evolve and change. Release any guilt or shame, and focus on nurturing a practice that brings you joy and fulfillment.\n4. **Experiment and try new things**: Don't be afraid to try different spiritual practices, even if they seem unconventional or unfamiliar. Attend workshops, take online courses, or join groups that align with your interests. This will help you discover what resonates with you and what doesn't.\n5. **Listen to your intuition**: Pay attention to your inner voice and bodily sensations. When you're exploring a new practice, notice how you feel. Do you feel a sense of peace, excitement, or curiosity? Or do you feel uneasy or disconnected? Trust your intuition to guide you toward a practice that feels authentic.\n6. **Find a community or accountability partner**: Having a supportive community or accountability partner can be invaluable in your spiritual journey. Seek out like-minded individuals who share your interests and values. This could be an online forum, a local meetup group, or a spiritual mentor.\n7. **Be patient and gentle with yourself**: Transitioning to a new spiritual practice takes time, and it's essential to be patient and gentle with yourself. Don't expect to find the \"perfect\" practice overnight. Allow yourself to grow, learn, and evolve at your own pace.\n8. **Integrate spiritual practices into daily life**: Find ways to incorporate your spiritual practice into your daily routine, such as meditation, journaling, or nature walks. This will help you cultivate a deeper sense of connection and make your practice feel more sustainable.\n9. **Celebrate your uniqueness**: Embrace the fact that your spiritual journey is unique and may not look like anyone else's. Celebrate your individuality and the diversity of spiritual practices that exist.\n10. **Trust the process**: Lastly, trust that you're exactly where you need to be. Trust that your spiritual journey is unfolding as it should, and that you'll find a practice that resonates with you. Have faith in yourself and the universe's guidance.\n\nRemember, my friend, your spiritual journey is a personal and evolving path.

        "content": "The fascinating world of chakras! I'd be happy to introduce you to the basics of chakras and their significance in our physical and emotional well-being.\n\n**What are Chakras?**\n\nIn Hindu and Buddhist traditions, chakras (Sanskrit: चakra, \"wheel\" or \"circle\") are believed to be energy centers within the human body. They're thought to be spinning wheels of energy that connect our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual bodies. There are seven main chakras, each located along the spine, from the base of the spine to the crown of the head.\n\n**The 7 Main Chakras:**\n\n1. **Root Chakra (Muladhara)**: Located at the base of the spine, this chakra represents stability, security, and grounding. It's associated with the color red and the element earth.\n2. **Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana)**: Located in the lower abdomen, this chakra represents creativity, emotions, and pleasure. It's associated with the color orange and the element water.\n3. **Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)**: Located in the upper abdomen, this chakra represents personal power, self-esteem, and willpower. It's associated with the color yellow and the element fire.\n4. **Heart Chakra (Anahata)**: Located in the center of the chest, this chakra represents love, compassion, and relationships. It's associated with the color green and the element air.\n5. **Throat Chakra (Vishuddha)**: Located in the throat, this chakra represents communication, self-expression, and personal truth. It's associated with the color blue and the element ether (or space).\n6. **Third Eye Chakra (Ajna)**: Located between the eyebrows, this chakra represents intuition, insight, and higher consciousness. It's associated with the color indigo and the element light.\n7. **Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)**: Located at the crown of the head, this chakra represents spiritual connection, enlightenment, and higher states of consciousness. It's associated with the color violet and the element pure consciousness.\n\n**How Chakras Work:**\n\nChakras are believed to influence various aspects of our lives, including our physical health, emotions, thoughts, and spiritual growth. Each chakra is connected to specific organs, glands, and systems in the body, and they're thought to regulate the flow of energy (prana or chi) throughout the body.\n\nWhen a chakra is balanced and open, the corresponding aspects of our lives are thought to be in harmony. However, when a chakra is blocked or imbalanced, it can lead to physical, emotional, or mental issues. For example, a blocked Root Chakra might manifest as anxiety or feelings of insecurity, while a blocked Heart Chakra might lead to relationship problems or emotional numbness.\n\n**Balancing and Aligning Chakras:**\n\nThere are various techniques to balance and align the chakras, including:\n\n* Meditation and visualization\n* Yoga and breathwork\n* Energy healing (Reiki, acupuncture, etc.)\n* Sound healing (chanting, singing bowls, etc.)\n* Crystal healing\n* Aromatherapy\n* Physical exercises and postures (asanas)\n\nBy understanding and working with the chakras, you can potentially improve your overall well-being, increase your self-awareness, and connect with your spiritual nature.\n\nThis is just a brief introduction to the world of chakras. I hope this sparks your curiosity and inspires you to explore further!"

Congrats on the new tackle box, too!\n\nFor bass fishing, it's essential to consider the time of day, water conditions, and the bass's natural feeding habits. Here are some popular and effective lures for catching bass:\n\n**Topwater Lures**\n\n1. **Popper**: A classic choice, poppers create a commotion on the surface, attracting bass from a distance.\n2. **Frog Lure**: Ideal for fishing near vegetation, frog lures mimic the movement of a frog and can be very effective.\n\n**Crankbaits**\n\n1. **Shad-imitating Crankbait**: These lures resemble baitfish and can be used to target bass at varying depths.\n2. **Chartreuse or Bright-Colored Crankbait**: These lures can be effective in murky or stained water.\n\n**Soft Plastics**\n\n1. **Curly Tail Grub**: A versatile lure that can be used on a jighead, Texas rig, or Carolina rig.\n2. **Soft Plastic Worm**: A classic bass lure, soft plastic worms can be rigged in various ways and are effective in many situations.\n\n**Jigs**\n\n1. **Jig and Pig**: A 1/8 to 1/4 oz. jig with a curly tail or swim bait trailer can be deadly for bass.\n2. **Bass Jig**: A heavier jig (1/2 oz. to 1 oz.) with a crawdad or baitfish trailer can be effective in deeper water.\n\n**Other Options**\n\n1. **Spinnerbait**: A spinnerbait can be used to cover a lot of water and attract bass from a distance.\n2. **Swimbaits**: These lures mimic baitfish and can be used to target bass in open water.\n\nRemember to always check the local fishing regulations for any specific lure restrictions or guidelines. Additionally, consider the water temperature, clarity, and structure when choosing your lures.\n\nOrganizing your tackle box:\n\n* Store lures by type (e.g., crankbaits, soft plastics, jigs) to make it easier to find what you need.\n* Use dividers or small compartments to separate lures and prevent them from getting tangled or damaged.\n* Keep your most frequently used lures in easy-to-reach locations.\n\nHave a great fishing trip, and I hope you catch some nice bass!"

        "content": "Purple-patterned spinners can be very effective!\n\nSetting the hook with soft plastics requires a bit of finesse, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it. Here are some tips to help you set the hook effectively:\n\n1. **Use a gentle, sweeping motion**: When you feel a bite, don't yank the rod too hard. Instead, use a gentle, sweeping motion to set the hook. This helps to reduce the likelihood of pulling the lure out of the bass's mouth.\n2. **Wait for the right moment**: Allow the bass to take the lure for a second or two before setting the hook. This gives the bass time to fully engulf the lure, making it easier to set the hook.\n3. **Use the rod's flexibility**: Instead of trying to muscle the fish, use the rod's flexibility to absorb the initial impact. This helps to reduce the shock on the line and increases the chances of a solid hookset.\n4. **Keep the line at a 45-degree angle**: Try to maintain a 45-degree angle between the rod tip and the water's surface. This helps to ensure the hook sets in the corner of the bass's mouth.\n5. **Use the right hook**: Choose a hook that's designed for soft plastics, such as an EWG (Extra Wide Gap) hook or a hook with a bait holder. These hooks have a wider gap, which makes it easier to set the hook in the bass's mouth.\n6. **Don't over-tighten**: Once you've set the hook, don't over-tighten the line. Give the bass some room to move and struggle, which will help to secure the hook.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice!**: Setting the hook with soft plastics takes practice, so don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Keep trying, and you'll develop the necessary skills.\n\nWhen combining soft plastics with your purple-patterned spinners, you can try the following:\n\n* Rig the soft plastic on a jighead or a Texas rig, and attach the spinner to the hook or the swivel.\n* Use a spinnerbait trailer hook with a soft plastic trailer. This allows the bass to grab the trailer while the spinnerbait does its job of attracting attention.\n* Try a \"stroll-and-roll\" technique, where you slowly retrieve the spinnerbait while occasionally stopping and letting it sink. This can help to trigger a strike from a bass.\n\nRemember to experiment with different retrieves, presentations, and lure combinations to find what works best for you and the bass in your lake.\n\nGood luck on your fishing trip, and I hope you land some nice bass!"

Here are some tips to help you teach kids to set a hook:\n\n1. **Start with the basics**: Before teaching kids to set a hook, make sure they understand the basics of fishing, such as casting, reeling, and handling fish.\n2. **Use kid-friendly tackle**: Choose tackle that's appropriate for your child's age and skill level. Lighter rods and reels with smaller hooks can make it easier for kids to handle and set hooks.\n3. **Practice with a \"hookless\" lure**: Start by practicing with a lure that doesn't have a hook, such as a soft plastic worm or a foam lure. This allows kids to get a feel for the motion of setting a hook without the risk of hooking themselves or others.\n4. **Demonstrate and explain**: Show your kids how to set a hook by demonstrating the motion yourself. Explain the importance of setting the hook quickly and gently, and how it helps to catch fish.\n5. **Break it down into steps**: Break down the process of setting a hook into smaller steps, such as:\n\t* Feeling the tug on the line\n\t* Reacting quickly to the bite\n\t* Sweeping the rod to set the hook\n\t* Holding the rod at a 45-degree angle\n6. **Use positive reinforcement**: Praise your kids when they successfully set a hook, even if it's just a small fish. Positive reinforcement can help build their confidence and encourage them to continue learning.\n7. **Practice, practice, practice!**: The more your kids practice setting hooks, the more comfortable they'll become with the motion. Encourage them to practice regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time.\n8. **Make it fun**: Remember to keep the experience fun and engaging for your kids. If they're not having fun, they'll be less likely to want to learn.\n9. **Be patient**: Setting a hook can be a difficult skill to master, especially for young kids. Be patient and encouraging, and don't get frustrated if they struggle at first.\n10. **Celebrate their successes**: Celebrate your kids' successes, no matter how small they may seem. This can help build their confidence and encourage them to continue fishing and learning.\n\nAdditionally, here are a few tips for teaching kids to set a hook with soft plastics:\n\n* Start with soft plastics that are easy to hook, such as curly tail grubs or soft plastic worms.\n* Use a hook that's designed for soft plastics, such as an EWG hook.\n* Practice setting the hook with the soft plastic lure attached to the hook.\n* Encourage kids to use a gentle, sweeping motion to set the hook.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help your kids develop the skills and confidence they need to set a hook and catch fish.

Here are some tips to help you create a stunning abstract piece:\n\n1. **Let go of control**: Abstract art is all about embracing the unknown. Don't worry too much about creating a perfect piece. Focus on the process, and let your emotions guide your brushstrokes.\n2. **Experiment with materials**: Try different paints, mediums, and tools to achieve unique textures and effects. Some popular materials for abstract art include:\n\t* Acrylic paints (thick, heavy-body, or fluid)\n\t* Mixed media (collage, paper, fabric, found objects)\n\t* Oil paints\n\t* Watercolors\n\t* Markers or pastels\n\t* Palette knives\n\t* Sponges\n3. **Choose a color palette**: Select a range of colors that evoke a specific mood or emotion. You can:\n\t* Use a limited palette (monochromatic or analogous colors)\n\t* Experiment with bold, contrasting colors\n\t* Create a harmonious palette with similar hues\n4. **Start with a gesture**: Begin with a loose, expressive gesture to set the tone for your piece. This could be a sweeping brushstroke, a splash of color, or a geometric shape.\n5. **Build up layers**: Abstract art often involves layering different elements to create depth and visual interest. Experiment with:\n\t* Glazing (layering transparent colors)\n\t* Scumbling (applying a thin layer of opaque paint over a base color)\n\t* Scraping or removing paint to reveal underlying layers\n6. **Play with texture**: Add dimensionality to your piece by incorporating different textures, such as:\n\t* Thick, impasto paint\n\t* Smooth, blended colors\n\t* Rough, scrubbed surfaces\n\t* Collage elements (paper, fabric, or found objects)\n7. **Emphasize movement and energy**: Abstract art often conveys a sense of movement or energy. Try to capture this through:\n\t* Dynamic brushstrokes\n\t* Expressive mark-making\n\t* Contrasting colors or values\n8. **Step back and evaluate**: As you work, regularly step back from your piece to assess its balance, composition, and overall feel. Make adjustments as needed to maintain a sense of harmony.\n9. **Don't overthink it**: Remember, abstract art is subjective. Don't worry if your piece doesn't look like someone else's work. Focus on expressing yourself and having fun!\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you create, the more comfortable you'll become with abstract expressionism. Experiment with different techniques, and don't be afraid to try new things.\n\nSome famous abstract expressionist artists to draw inspiration from include:\n\n* Jackson Pollock\n* Willem de Kooning\n* Mark Rothko\n* Franz Kline\n* Joan Mitchell\n* Helen Frankenthaler\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of creating!",

Balancing bold colors can be a challenge, but with some tips and tricks, you can achieve a dynamic and harmonious artwork. Here are some tips to help you balance bold colors:\n\n1. **Start with a dominant color**: Choose a bold, bright color as the dominant color and use it as the foundation for your piece. This will help create a sense of unity and cohesion.\n2. **Use a neutral background**: A neutral background (e.g., white, gray, or black) can help balance bold colors and create contrast. This also allows you to add pops of color without overwhelming the piece.\n3. **Balance warm and cool colors**: Mix warm colors (e.g., red, orange, yellow) with cool colors (e.g., blue, green, purple) to create visual interest and balance. Warm colors tend to advance, while cool colors recede.\n4. **Play with saturation**: Vary the saturation levels of your bold colors to create contrast and visual interest. Desaturate or mute certain areas to create a sense of depth and dimensionality.\n5. **Use color harmony principles**: Apply color harmony principles like complementary, analogous, or triadic color schemes to create a sense of balance and coherence.\n6. **Add a unifying element**: Introduce a unifying element, such as a repeating shape, pattern, or texture, to tie the bold colors together and create a sense of harmony.\n7. **Experiment with layering**: Layering bold colors can create a sense of depth and visual interest. Experiment with glazing, scumbling, or impasto techniques to achieve the desired effect.\n8. **Pay attention to value**: Balance bold colors by considering their value (lightness or darkness). High-contrast combinations can be striking, but be cautious not to overwhelm the piece.\n9. **Create a focal point**: Designate a focal point in your piece where the bold colors converge or contrast. This will draw the viewer's attention and create visual interest.\n10. **Step back and evaluate**: Regularly step back from your piece to assess the balance of bold colors. Make adjustments as needed to achieve a harmonious and dynamic artwork.\n\nSome famous artists who have mastered bold and bright color palettes include:\n\n* Joan Miró\n* Henri Matisse\n* Pablo Picasso (in his later works)\n* Bridget Riley\n* Ellsworth Kelly\n\nRemember, balancing bold colors is a process of experimentation and iteration. Don't be afraid to try new combinations and adjust as you go. With practice and patience, you'll develop your own unique style and voice in abstract art.",

        "content": "Scientists use DNA sequencing to identify potential treatments for genetic diseases by first identifying the specific genetic mutations responsible for the disease. They can do this by comparing the DNA of affected individuals to that of seemingly healthy individuals. Once the mutations are identified, researchers can investigate how the altered genes and their products contribute to the disease. This information can help them identify potential targets for drug development.\n\nNext, scientists can use DNA sequencing to develop personalized treatments tailored to the specific genetic mutations of individual patients. This approach is particularly relevant for some types of cancer, which often arise from unique combinations of genetic mutations in individual patients.\n\nIn addition, DNA sequencing can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments and identify potential drug resistance mechanisms. This information can help researchers refine existing treatments or develop new ones that are better suited to specific patients or more effective in fighting the disease.\n\nOverall, DNA sequencing has opened up new avenues for understanding and treating genetic diseases, and it is likely to play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine in the years to come."

This technology utilizes an enzyme called Cas9, which can be programmed to cut DNA at a specific location, and a guiding RNA molecule that targets the specific location to be cut.\n\nIn genetic disease research, CRISPR technology can be used to correct genetic mutations that cause disease by introducing healthy copies of the mutated gene into a patient's genome. It is also being used to develop new therapies for genetic diseases, such as gene silencing or activation, using RNA molecules that guide the Cas9 enzyme to specific sites in the genome.\n\nOne of the most promising applications of CRISPR technology in genetic disease research is in the field of gene therapy. Gene therapy aims to correct or replace a defective or missing gene to cure or treat a disease. CRISPR technology has the potential to help in this process by allowing scientists to replace the faulty gene with a healthy gene or correct the mutation that causes the disease.\n\nAdditionally, CRISPR technology is being used in disease modeling, where scientists can create precise genetic mutations in cell lines or animal models to study the effects of specific mutations on disease development and progression. These models can help identify new targets for drug development and test potential therapies for genetic diseases.\n\nOverall, CRISPR technology offers a wide range of applications in genetic disease research, from gene therapy to disease modeling, and is revolutionizing the way researchers approach the understanding and treatment of genetic diseases."

        "content": "Role level, application permissions, and security roles are all related to controlling access and permissions in Power Apps and the Common Data Service (CDS). Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. Role Level:\nRole-level security is used to restrict access to data at the row or record level. It is based on a user's role, or group of roles, and the data they are authorized to view or edit. This type of security is commonly used to ensure that users only have access to the data that they need for their job.\n2. Application Permissions:\nApplication permissions provide access to functionality across the entire application, regardless of the data that is being accessed. These permissions are granted to security roles, and they determine what users can do within the application. Examples of application permissions include creating and editing records, managing users, and publishing the application.\n3. Security Roles:\nSecurity roles are used to control access to data and functionality within the application. They define a set of permissions that determine what users can do within the application. Security roles can be assigned to individual users or groups of users, and they can be customized to meet the needs of the organization. Examples of security roles include system administrator, sales manager, and customer service representative.\n\nIn summary, role level security controls access to data at the record level, application permissions control access to functionality across the entire application, and security roles control access to data and functionality within the application. All three are important for managing access and permissions in Power Apps and CDS."

Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week to target these areas.\n6. **Incorporate Rest and Recovery**: Rest and recovery are just as important as running. Ensure you're getting 1-2 rest days per week and prioritizing stretching, foam rolling, and self-myofascial release.\n7. **Hydrate and Fuel Properly**: Adequate hydration and nutrition are crucial for optimal performance. Focus on consuming a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and fueling your runs with the right snacks and electrolytes.\n8. **Get Enough Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body recover from the physical demands of running.\n9. **Mix Up Your Route and Terrain**: Varying your route and terrain can help reduce the risk of overuse injuries. Incorporate hills, trails, and different surfaces to keep your runs interesting and challenging.\n10. **Seek Professional Guidance**: If you're new to running or unsure about how to increase your mileage safely, consider consulting a running coach or experienced runner for personalized guidance.\n\nRegarding your new shoes, it's great that you're feeling the difference in terms of cushioning and support! Make sure to break them in gradually by wearing them for shorter runs and gradually increasing the distance.\n\nRemember, consistency and patience are key when increasing your mileage. Stay committed to your training plan, listen to your body, and you'll be ready to crush your half-marathon in no time!"

        "content": "Congratulations on your new orchid! Winter can be a challenging time for orchids, but with proper care, your new addition can thrive. Here are some valuable tips to help you care for your orchid during the winter months:\n\n1. **Lighting:** Orchids generally require bright, indirect light. During winter, the days are shorter, and the sun is lower in the sky, so you may need to adjust the placement of your orchid. East- or west-facing windows are ideal. If you don't have a suitable window, consider using grow lights to supplement the natural light.\n2. **Temperature:** Most orchids prefer daytime temperatures between 65°F to 75°F (18°C to 24°C) and nighttime temperatures 5-10°F (3-6°C) lower. Some orchids, like Phalaenopsis, can tolerate cooler temperatures, while others, like Vanda, require warmer temperatures. Check the specific needs of your orchid variety.\n3. **Humidity:** Orchids thrive in humid environments, typically between 40-70% relative humidity. To maintain humidity, you can:\n\t* Place the orchid pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles.\n\t* Use a humidifier nearby.\n\t* Group plants together to create a microclimate.\n4. **Watering:** Overwatering is a common mistake during winter. Orchids need less water when it's cold, as the roots are less active. Water your orchid only when the potting media is dry to the touch, usually once a week. Watering once every 10-14 days is a good rule of thumb.\n5. **Fertilizing:** Feed your orchid with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) at half the recommended strength. You can fertilize once a month, but it's not essential during the winter months when growth is slower.\n6. **Repotting:** Avoid repotting your orchid during winter, as this can cause stress. If your orchid is pot-bound, wait until spring when it becomes more active.\n7. **Pruning:** Remove dead or dying flowers, stems, or leaves to promote healthy growth and prevent the spread of disease.\n8. **Pest control:** Inspect your orchid regularly for pests like mealybugs, spider mites, or scale. Isolate your orchid from other plants to prevent the spread of pests.\n9. **Protection from drafts:** Keep your orchid away from cold drafts, radiators, and air conditioning vents, which can cause sudden temperature fluctuations.\n10. **Monitor for disease:** Winter conditions can lead to root rot and other diseases. Monitor your orchid for signs of disease, such as soft, mushy stems, black spots, or white powdery patches. If you notice any issues, treat promptly with a fungicide.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to provide your orchid with the care it needs to thrive during the winter months. Enjoy your new addition, and happy growing!"

        "content": "You're on the right track with the east-facing windowsill!\n\nA small humidifier in the living room can definitely make a positive impact on the humidity level around your orchid. However, the effectiveness of a humidifier depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. Room size: A small humidifier (e.g., 1-2 gallons per day) is suitable for a small to medium-sized room (100-200 sq. ft.). If your living room is larger, you might need a more powerful humidifier.\n2. Humidifier type: Cool mist humidifiers are generally more effective at increasing humidity than warm mist humidifiers. Ultrasonic humidifiers are also a good option, as they produce a fine mist that can be more easily dispersed throughout the room.\n3. Distance from the orchid: Place the humidifier within 3-5 feet of your orchid to ensure the mist reaches the plant.\n4. Room layout: If your living room has a lot of air circulation (e.g., near a door or window), the humidifier might need to work harder to maintain the desired humidity level.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* A small humidifier (1-2 gallons per day) can increase the humidity by 10-20% in a small room.\n* A medium-sized humidifier (2-4 gallons per day) can increase the humidity by 20-30% in a medium-sized room.\n* A large humidifier (4-6 gallons per day) can increase the humidity by 30-40% or more in a larger room.\n\nFor an orchid, a humidity level of 40-60% is ideal. If you're concerned about the humidity in your living room, you can monitor it using a hygrometer (a device that measures humidity).\n\nIf you decide to get a humidifier, start with a small one and observe the effect it has on the humidity level around your orchid. You can always adjust or upgrade later if needed.\n\nSome popular small humidifier options include:\n\n* Honeywell HUL520W Mistmate Humidifier\n* Levoit LV600HH Hybrid Humidifier\n* Crane Drop Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier\n\nRemember to clean and maintain your humidifier regularly to ensure it continues to work efficiently and effectively.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Having other plants in the room can definitely impact the effectiveness of a small humidifier. Here's what to consider:\n\n1. **Additional moisture demand:** Each plant will absorb some of the moisture released by the humidifier, which means the humidifier will need to work harder to maintain the desired humidity level. This might reduce the overall effectiveness of the humidifier, especially if you have multiple plants.\n2. **Competition for moisture:** Plants with different moisture requirements might compete for the available moisture. For example, your snake plant might prefer drier conditions, while your basil plant might thrive in a more humid environment. Your orchid, being a tropical plant, will likely benefit from higher humidity.\n3. **Microclimates:** Each plant creates its own microclimate, which can affect the surrounding air. For instance, plants with larger leaves or more dense foliage can create a microclimate with higher humidity around themselves. This might reduce the impact of the humidifier on the surrounding air.\n\nHowever, there are some benefits to having multiple plants in the room:\n\n1. **Transpiration:** Plants release moisture into the air through a process called transpiration. This can contribute to a more humid environment, especially if you have multiple plants.\n2. **Air circulation:** Having multiple plants can encourage air circulation, which can help distribute the moisture released by the humidifier more evenly throughout the room.\n\nTo make a small humidifier work effectively in your living room with multiple plants, consider the following:\n\n1. **Choose a humidifier with adjustable output:** Look for a humidifier that allows you to adjust the mist output or has multiple speed settings. This will enable you to fine-tune the humidifier's performance based on the needs of your plants.\n2. **Group plants together:** Place your plants, including the orchid, snake plant, and basil plant, together to create a microclimate with higher humidity. This can help the humidifier's moisture reach all the plants more effectively.\n3. **Monitor humidity levels:** Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level in the room and adjust the humidifier's output accordingly.\n4. **Consider a humidifier with a larger tank:** If you have multiple plants, you might need a humidifier with a larger tank to ensure it can provide enough moisture for all of them.\n\nIn your case, a small humidifier might still be effective, but you might need to adjust its output or placement to accommodate the needs of your multiple plants. Keep an eye on the humidity level and adjust as needed to ensure all your plants thrive."

        "content": "What a great idea! Air-purifying plants can be a wonderful addition to both your bedroom and living room. While it's technically possible to move plants between rooms, it's not the most effective way to maintain optimal humidity levels and air quality in both spaces. Here's why:\n\n1. **Acclimation:** Plants adapt to their environment, including temperature, humidity, and light conditions. Moving them between rooms can cause stress, and they might struggle to adjust to the new conditions.\n2. **Humidity levels:** Bedrooms and living rooms often have different humidity levels. Bedrooms tend to be more humid due to showering, cooking, and human activity, while living rooms might be drier due to air conditioning or heating. Moving plants between rooms can disrupt their ability to thrive in their preferred humidity range.\n3. **Lighting:** Lighting conditions can vary significantly between rooms. Bedrooms might have softer, more gentle light, while living rooms often have brighter, more direct light. Plants may not tolerate the sudden change in lighting, which can impact their health and effectiveness in purifying the air.\n4. **Pest control:** Moving plants between rooms can spread pests, like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale, from one room to another.\n\nInstead, consider getting separate plants for each room. This will allow you to:\n\n1. **Optimize plant selection:** Choose plants that thrive in the specific conditions of each room. For example, you might choose plants that prefer higher humidity for your bedroom and plants that tolerate drier conditions for your living room.\n2. **Maintain optimal humidity:** By having separate plants in each room, you can maintain the ideal humidity level for each space. This will help your plants thrive and provide the best air-purifying benefits.\n3. **Reduce stress:** Separate plants for each room means you won't need to worry about moving them between spaces, which can cause stress and disrupt their ability to purify the air effectively.\n\nIf you still want to share plants between rooms, consider the following:\n\n1. **Choose hardy plants:** Select plants that are more adaptable to changing conditions, such as Spider Plants or Pothos.\n2. **Monitor and adjust:** Keep a close eye on your plants' condition and adjust their care accordingly. If you notice any signs of stress, consider providing additional care or separating the plants.\n3. **Limit movement:** If you do decide to move plants between rooms, try to limit the frequency and duration of the moves. This will help minimize the stress caused by the changes.\n\nRemember, it's always better to prioritize your plants' health and well-being. By providing optimal conditions and care, you'll get the most benefit from your air-purifying plants in both your bedroom and living room."

victory dance?\n When you broke ran into that?\n Yeah, that's great.\n It's a big deal.\n Huge.\n Yeah, just...\n It's just fundamental economics.\n It kind of makes sense that making cars on the continent where there are boards will\n be a lot more efficient than making them in California and chipping them around the world.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And you can get paid for the cars before paying your suppliers, which seems to not be the\n case if you're shipping around the world.\n Right.\n And it's like friction on the whole kind of cash flow situation or it has been.\n For sure.\n It will sure make a big difference on cash flow because yeah, there's just no way to\n get the cars, especially to Europe, but we're even trying to get them to customers before\n we have to pay suppliers.\n So if you're a rapidly growing company, it's nine day if you get paid by your customers\n before you have to pay your suppliers, like night and day.\n Because in the faster you grow, the video cash position is.\n But if it's the other way around where you have to pay your suppliers before you get paid\n by customers, then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position drops.\n Yes, you're up, yes.\n Because you spend more money to make your own.\n Yes, it's a growth actually causes you to over into the ground in a situation like that.\n Now it tells you we had a mixture of both things where we had a lot of customers in\n say in California.\n And that's fast.\n For sure, we would get paid by customers faster than we'd have to pay suppliers.\n But then for cars going to Europe and Asia, it's the other way around.\n So we would have to pay suppliers before we got paid by customers.\n And now we could offset some of that with the asset back line, which was pretty helpful,\n but only some of it, not all of it.\n So the fundamental financial health for sure improves dramatically by just having a factory\n on the continent.\n We're not talking next door, but it's just how many ocean, especially Europe was logistically\n super hard because we're on the West Coast.\n If we're on the East Coast, then China would be much harder.\n But if you're on the West Coast, you're from the charter because you've got to go to the\n Panama Canal or even worse around Tierra del Fuego.\n Because sometimes the Panama Canal get backed up and you're like, \"This friggin' ship is\n going to the Antarctic.\"\n It's like you could skip up to the end and it stole me as hell.\n It's just so you could just send a ship around chilling.\n Are you kidding?\n In the middle of crazy storms and then back up all the way and then it is too funny.\n Oh my God.\n So let me just take nightmare.\n So yeah, it'd be great to just have it not get on a boat.\n It crossed the Pacific and Atlantic and that kind of thing.\n So maybe similar to Vincent's question, what's the biggest advantage in choosing Berlin\n compared to other European countries?\n Berlin has the best nightclubs.\n That's true.\n How many bit?\n I went to Brooklyn once.\n Really?\n Yeah.\n Holy shit.\n That's cool.\n Yeah, it was a few years ago.\n Well, I don't know.\n I mean, he looked at a lot of different locations and I don't know.\n We could have put him in a lot of locations.\n We needed to move quickly and actually this place, it's like 30 minutes to the outskirts\n of Berlin, technically in Brandenburg.\n It actually was a place location that BMW was going to put a plant there.\n So a ton of the environmental work and all of the permits and stuff had already been\n done.\n And then for some reason, BMW chose a different location.\n But there's like, I guess, something on the order of a year's worth of environmental paperwork\n and stuff that's been done on that location for an auto plant.\n So that's one of the quickest places to get going.\n And generally, the government, local and state government was very supportive.\n So I went there and it's like, OK, this seems like some pretty good vibes this place.\n So this is a lovely part of this lovely place.\n And there's an opportunity for-- it's close enough to Berlin that say young people could\n still live in an apartment in Berlin and commute to the factory.\n It's right, there's a train station.\n They actually can move the train station.\n It's a small train station.\n But they're going to move the train station to where you can literally get off the train\n and be right at the gig of Berlin.\n Wow.\n That's great.\n That's great.\n It could literally just pop right off and walk very unadvisable.\n So then it's like, OK, this is pretty cool.\n And so young people could be in Berlin, apartment, and it's a little quirky here in Berlin.\n But if you want to have more of a family situation, the backyard is affordable, housing available\n with houses with yards and stuff that aren't too expensive.\n Yeah.\n So it seems like a good combination of factors.\n Yeah, a lot of talent in the area.\n So it sounds cool to Google in.\n It just sounds like some cool nightclub, I think.\n You could definitely have a cool nightclub that was cool, but yeah, it sounds good.\n It sounds pretty cool.\n It's pretty fun.\n It's a party gig-ish.\n Yeah.\n It's sort of like a rave cave in the...\n There's a lot of space around the factory side.\n But you should have your own nightclub.\n Yeah.\n I think that would be...\n Who doesn't know what to do?\n I don't know if he doesn't know what to do with that.\n I feel like I'd go for sure a work at a company that's got the nightclub.\n That sounds way more fun.\n Didn't you want to put a roller coaster into the Fremont factory?\n Yeah.\n You're still going to do that?\n I mean, I think that would be pretty fun to do.\n Yeah.\n I think we can just do...\n Yeah, just basically have like...\n We just needed a rail that can support like a modified Tesla's.\n And then...\n Oh my God.\n Can you imagine a plaid flat?\n Yeah, just like zip around.\n Around the factory in like five seconds.\n Yours would be booked for months.\n Yeah, we should get it right now.\n Awesome.\n Yeah, we're kind of actually in various parts of the factory, we have vehicle conveyance\n systems.\n They just don't move that fast.\n But they're kind of like roller coasters that move slowly.\n You can speed up.\n Yeah, you can speed up.\n Exactly.\n So, yeah.\n But yeah, we're all from feeling pretty...\n You know, we're not a tent fade or anything, but feeling pretty good about where things\n are headed.\n And I think this is a lot of good things.\n You know, Model Y coming out this year.\n And some exciting announcements about batteries.\n A lot of progress in autopilot.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, pulling, giga-balloon.\n And then making progress in some of the new vehicle developments.\n And solo the solar roof, solar glass roof.\n Getting that rolled out.\n The Cybertruck got received really well, I think.\n Yeah.\n Did you expect that many orders?\n No, not really.\n It's amazing.\n When I first saw the Cybertruck in France's design studio, I mean, you know, it had told\n me that this was a daring design.\n Although, I think you're the most excited about this design than any design.\n Yeah, I thought it would be the best product ever.\n Yeah.\n And I saw it.\n I was just taken aback.\n And not by the design so much, by the pure aggression that the truck, you stand in front\n of it and you're like, \"Okay, I'm afraid.\"\n You know, it really is like a badass truck.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Well, it seems like a lot of reasons why people buy pickup trucks in the US is like,\n because it's like the most badass truck.\n You know, like, which one is the toughest truck?\n And it's like, what's tougher than a truck?\n A tank.\n That's a good one.\n Like a tank from the future.\n So, it's like...\n My niece and Parker, which is near Paloburishi, the dirt bath, rider, champion, and a really\n fine side of the truck to the order just the day...\n Fine side of

Here are some popular and highly-rated air purifier recommendations:\n\n1. **Levoit LV-H132**: A budget-friendly option with a compact design, 3-stage filtration, and a quiet operation. It's suitable for small to medium-sized rooms (129 sq. ft.). (~ $90)\n2. **Dyson Pure Cool Link**: A premium air purifier with a sleek design, advanced filtration, and a built-in fan. It's ideal for medium to large rooms (400 sq. ft.). (~ $300)\n3. **Honeywell HPA300**: A popular and affordable option with a 3-stage filtration system, allergen remover, and a quiet operation. It's suitable for medium-sized rooms (465 sq. ft.). (~ $200)\n4. **Coway AP-1512GA**: A highly-rated air purifier with a 4-stage filtration system, air quality sensor, and a sleek design.

(~ $200)\n5. **Austin Air HealthMate Plus**: A high-end air purifier with a 4-stage filtration system, large coverage area (1500 sq. ft.), and a durable design. (~ $450)\n\nWhen choosing an air purifier, consider the following factors:\n\n* Room size: Make sure the air purifier is designed for a room of your size.\n* Filtration system: Look for a 3- or 4-stage system that captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns (HEPA filter).\n* CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate): A higher CADR means the air purifier can handle more air circulation.\n* Noise level: If you plan to use it in your bedroom, look for an air purifier with a low noise level or a silent mode.\n* Additional features: Some air purifiers come with features like air quality sensors, timers, or smart sensors.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend reading reviews on Amazon or other websites to get a better understanding of each product's performance, pros, and cons.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect air purifier for your bedroom!"

Both air purifiers are known for their effectiveness in removing allergens and odors from the air. Here's a brief comparison of their features:\n\n**Honeywell HPA300:**\n\n* 3-stage filtration system:\n\t1. Pre-filter captures large particles (e.g., dust, hair)\n\t2. Activated carbon filter reduces odors, gases, and VOCs (volatile organic compounds)\n\t3. True HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns (allergens, dust, pollen)\n* Captures allergens, dust, mold, and bacteria\n* Reduces odors from pets, smoke, and cooking\n* Turbo mode for faster cleaning\n* Suitable for medium-sized rooms (465 sq. ft.)\n\n**Coway AP-1512GA:**\n\n* 4-stage filtration system:\n\t1.

True HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns (allergens, dust, pollen)\n\t4. Ionizer (optional) helps to trap particles and freshen the air\n* Captures allergens, dust, mold, and bacteria\n* Reduces odors from pets, smoke, and cooking\n* Air quality sensor adjusts fan speed based on air quality\n* Suitable for medium-sized rooms (360 sq. ft.)\n\nBoth air purifiers are effective in removing allergens and odors from the air. However, the Coway AP-1512GA has a slightly more advanced filtration system with an additional ionizer stage, which can help to freshen the air and trap particles more efficiently.\n\nIf you're particularly sensitive to odors, the Coway AP-1512GA might be a better choice. The ionizer can help to break down and eliminate odor molecules more effectively. On the other hand, if you prefer a more straightforward, no-frills air purifier with a simpler design, the Honeywell HPA300 might be the better option.\n\nBoth air purifiers are well-regarded by customers and have good reviews on Amazon. You can't go wrong with either choice!"

The humidifier will help to add moisture to the air, which can help to soothe your respiratory system and relieve congestion. Meanwhile, the Coway air purifier will work to remove allergens, odors, and other airborne pollutants from the air, making it easier to breathe and reducing the risk of respiratory issues.\n\nThe air quality sensor on the Coway AP-1512GA is a great feature, as it will continuously monitor the air quality in your bedroom and adjust the fan speed accordingly. This means that the air purifier will work harder when the air quality is poor and reduce its output when the air is clean, which can help to save energy and extend the life of the filter.\n\nRemember to replace the filter regularly to ensure the air purifier continues to work effectively. The Coway AP-1512GA has a filter replacement indicator, which will let you know when it's time to replace the filter.\n\nBy using both a humidifier and an air purifier, you'll be creating a comprehensive system for improving indoor air quality and promoting a healthier environment in your bedroom.

Economic changes: Globalization has led to the growth of multinational corporations and the spread of free trade agreements. As a result, some countries have seen an increase in their economic growth, while others have seen a decline in local industries and rise of unemployment.\n\n2. Cultural changes: Globalization has led to the spread of new ideas, lifestyles, and practices across the world. People have access to a variety of cultural products from different regions, and this has led to the emergence of new trends and styles.\n\n3. Environmental changes: Globalization has increased the movement of people, goods, and services across countries, which has created negative environmental impacts like pollution, deforestation, and climate change.\n\n4. Political changes: Globalization has increased the interconnectedness of countries and societies, leading to greater cooperation and collaboration on issues like trade, security, and human rights.\n\n5. Technological changes: Globalization has led to advancements in technology, which have improved people's lives in many ways. It has also changed the nature of work, with more people working in the knowledge-based economy.\n\nOverall, the impact of globalization on people's lives and livelihoods is complex and varied, and it depends on factors like where they live, their social and economic status, and their access to resources and opportunities."

The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) - it is a program that provides duty-free access to the markets of developed countries for products from developing countries.\n\n3. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) - it is an international certification system that promotes responsible management of forests and ensures that products originating from these forests meet strict environmental and social standards.\n\n4. The International Labour Organization's (ILO) \"decent work\" agenda - it promotes the rights of workers, social protection, and job creation to ensure that globalization benefits everyone.\n\n5. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - they provide a framework for countries and companies to reduce poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.\n\nThese policies and initiatives have had some success in mitigating the negative impacts of globalization, but there is still much work to be done to ensure that globalization benefits all people and does not contribute to inequality, poverty, or environmental degradation."
