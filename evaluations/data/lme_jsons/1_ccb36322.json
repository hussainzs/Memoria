I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations! As a conversational AI, I don't have personal preferences, but I can give you some general advice and point you in the right direction.\n\nFor turntables, it really depends on your budget and what you're looking for. If you're just starting out, a beginner-friendly option like the Audio-Technica AT-LP60BK or the U-Turn Orbit might be a great choice. If you're looking to upgrade, you could consider the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon DC or the Rega Planar 1.\n\nFor guitar equipment, it's also important to consider your budget and playing style. Here are a few general recommendations:\n\n* Electric guitars: If you're looking for a versatile guitar that can handle a variety of genres, the Fender Stratocaster or the Gibson Les Paul might be great options. If you're on a budget, consider the Squier by Fender Vintage Modified Stratocaster or the Epiphone Les Paul Special II.\n* Acoustic guitars: For a beginner-friendly acoustic guitar, the Taylor GS Mini or the Yamaha FG800 might be great choices. If you're looking to upgrade, consider the Taylor 814ce or the Martin D-28.\n* Amplifiers: For a practice amp, the Fender Mustang I V.2 or the Blackstar ID:Core 10 might be great options. If you're looking for a more powerful amp, consider the Fender Deluxe Reverb or the Marshall DSL20.\n\nIt's always a good idea to try out different gear before you buy, if possible. You might also want to consider visiting a local music store or talking to a music gear expert to get more personalized recommendations.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find gear that feels comfortable and inspires you to play!\n\nDo you have a favorite guitar brand or style that you're particularly interested in?",
