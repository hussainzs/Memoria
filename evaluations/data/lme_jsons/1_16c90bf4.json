        "content": "Here are a few more tips to keep in mind as you prepare your Seco de Cordero:\n\n1. It's best to use a tough cut of lamb for this recipe, such as shoulder or leg, as the long cooking time will help to tenderize the meat. 2. When browning the lamb, make sure not to overcrowd the pot or the meat will steam instead of searing. To ensure a nice crust, work in batches if necessary. 3. If you can't find fresh ají amarillo peppers or paste, you can substitute with other chili paste or powder that has a similar heat level and flavor profile. 4. You can adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe to your preference. If you like your stew to be thicker, use less water or beer. 5. Once the potatoes are added, it's important to stir them gently to avoid breaking them apart. You can also add them halfway through the cooking process if you prefer firmer potatoes. 6. Don't forget to taste and adjust the seasoning at the end of the cooking process to make sure the stew is well-seasoned to your liking. I hope these tips are helpful, and I wish you a great cooking experience and a delicious meal!",
