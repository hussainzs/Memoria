You can filter your search by rating, distance, and amenities like free Wi-Fi and outdoor seating.\n\nYou might also want to ask your coworkers or neighbors for recommendations.

I'm sure you'll continue to stumble upon more great spots as you get to know the area better.\n\nIn that case, I'd recommend building on what you've already discovered. Try to visit those coffee shops again and get a feel for the atmosphere, the coffee, and the service. You might find that one of them becomes your new go-to spot.\n\nYou could also try asking the baristas or staff at those coffee shops for recommendations on other great coffee spots in the area. They might have some insider knowledge on lesser-known gems that are worth checking out.\n\nAdditionally, you could try using online review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to discover more coffee shops in your area.
