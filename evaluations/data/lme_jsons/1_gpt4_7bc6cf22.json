I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\n**Overview:**\nThe trade tensions between the US and China have been ongoing since 2018, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The dispute is complex, involving issues like intellectual property, technology transfer, and market access. The situation remains fluid, with negotiations and escalations happening regularly.\n\n**Current Situation:**\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, the latest development is the Phase One trade deal signed on January 15, 2020.

However, many tariffs remain in place, and the deal's implementation is still being monitored.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1. **Tariffs:** The US has imposed tariffs on approximately $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with tariffs on around $110 billion worth of US goods.\n2. **Intellectual Property:** The US accuses China of forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, and inadequate protection for American companies' IP rights.\n3. **Market Access:** The US seeks greater access to China's markets, particularly in the financial and technology sectors.\n4. **Structural Reforms:** The US wants China to make significant structural reforms to its economy, including reducing state subsidies and increasing transparency.\n\n**Recommended Sources:**\n\n1. **The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE)**: A non-partisan think tank providing in-depth analysis on international trade and economics.\n2. **Bloomberg Economics**: Bloomberg's economics team offers comprehensive coverage of the trade tensions, including data, analysis, and news.\n3. **The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)**: A non-partisan think tank providing expert analysis on international relations, including the US-China trade relationship.\n4. **Reuters**: A reputable news agency offering up-to-date coverage of the trade tensions, including breaking news and in-depth analysis.\n5. **The Brookings Institution**: A non-profit public policy organization providing research and analysis on international trade and economics.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Follow reputable journalists and experts** on Twitter, such as Bloomberg's White House correspondent, Jennifer Jacobs, or the PIIE's senior fellow, Chad Bown.\n2. **Set up news alerts** for keywords like \"US-China trade\" or \"trade tensions\" to stay informed about the latest developments.\n3. **Consult multiple sources** to get a well-rounded understanding of the issue, as different sources may offer varying perspectives.\n\nBy following these sources and tips, you'll be well-informed about the US-China trade tensions and their implications for the global economy.",
