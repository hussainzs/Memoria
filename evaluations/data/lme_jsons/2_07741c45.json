Keeping them under the bed can indeed cause them to smell, especially if they're made of materials that absorb moisture. Here are some tips to help you store and care for your old sneakers:\n\n1. **Air them out**: Take your sneakers out of storage and let them air out for a few hours. This will help remove any trapped moisture and reduce odors.\n2. **Use shoe trees or stuffing**: Fill the shoes with paper towels, newspaper, or shoe trees to maintain their shape and absorb any moisture. This will prevent creasing and reduce odors.\n3. **Store them in a breathable bag**: Instead of storing them in a sealed plastic bag, use a breathable bag or a cloth bag with holes to allow air to circulate. You can also use a mesh bag or a sneaker storage bag with ventilation.\n4. **Keep them away from direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade. Store your sneakers in a shaded area or use a UV-resistant storage bag.\n5. **Clean them before storage**: Give your sneakers a good cleaning before storing them. This will remove dirt and debris that can cause odors. Use a gentle cleaning product and a soft brush to clean the exterior, and let them air dry.\n6. **Use odor-controlling products**: You can use odor-controlling products like baking soda, silica gel packets, or shoe deodorizers to absorb moisture and reduce odors.\n7. **Consider a shoe storage box**: If you have limited space, consider investing in a shoe storage box or a sneaker organizer. These can keep your shoes organized, protected, and ventilated.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your sneakers fresh and odor-free. Happy storing!",
