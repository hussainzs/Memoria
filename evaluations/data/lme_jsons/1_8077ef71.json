You can even set aside dedicated time for laundry, and then reward yourself with some TV time afterwards.\n\nAlso, consider setting a \"no work\" rule for the weekend, so you can fully disconnect from work-related tasks and focus on relaxation. This will help you come back to your project and other commitments feeling refreshed and motivated.\n\nOne more thing: don't forget to be kind to yourself and prioritize self-care. If you need an extra hour of sleep, take it. If you want to indulge in your favorite snack, go for it.
