Write them down and make them specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n\n**2. Use a Task List**:\nCreate a task list with all the activities you need to complete. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**3. Prioritize Tasks**:\nLabel each task with a priority level: High, Medium, or Low. Focus on completing the High-priority tasks first, followed by Medium, and then Low.\n\n**4. Create a Schedule**:\nPlan out your day, hour by hour. Allocate specific time slots for tasks, breaks, and self-care activities. Be realistic about how long each task will take, and leave some buffer time for unexpected things.\n\n**5. Use a Planner or Calendar**:\nWrite down all your tasks, appointments, and deadlines in a planner or calendar. This will help you visualize your week, avoid conflicts, and stay on track.\n\n**6. Focus on One Task at a Time**:\nAvoid multitasking, which can decrease productivity and increase stress. Focus on one task at a time, and give it your undivided attention.\n\n**7.
