Look for routes that follow grid patterns, as they tend to be flatter and more straightforward.\n2. Avoid routes with many turns or confusing intersections.\n3. Opt for routes with dedicated bike lanes or pedestrian paths, which are often designed to be flat and easy to follow.\n\n**Minimal Traffic:**\n\n1. Run on roads that are less busy during morning hours (7-8 am).\n2. Avoid major highways, busy intersections, and roads with heavy commercial traffic.\n3. Consider running on roads with traffic calming measures, such as speed bumps or chicanes, which can reduce traffic speed.\n\n**Good Lighting and Sidewalks/Pedestrian Paths:**\n\n1. Look for routes with well-lit streets, especially during early morning hours.\n2. Opt for routes with dedicated sidewalks or pedestrian paths, which are often well-maintained and well-lit.\n3. Avoid running on roads with inadequate lighting or narrow sidewalks.\n\n**Finding Routes:**\n\n1. Use online mapping tools like Google Maps or MapMyRun to explore your city's road network.\n2. Look for routes that follow parks, rivers, or waterfront areas, which often have dedicated pedestrian paths and scenic views.\n3. Check your city's website or local running groups for recommended running routes, which may have been vetted for safety and accessibility.\n\nSome specific route ideas to consider:\n\n* A loop around a local park or lake\n* A out-and-back route along a quiet, residential street\n* A route that follows a bike path or pedestrian trail\n* A route that takes you through a quiet neighborhood with low traffic\n\nRemember to always stay alert and aware of your surroundings while running, even on routes with good lighting and minimal traffic.
