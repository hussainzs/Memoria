This can help prevent plateaus and reduce the risk of injury.\n* **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your training over time to continue making progress.\n* **Active recovery**: Incorporate low-intensity activities, such as yoga or easy cycling, on rest days to aid in recovery and maintain flexibility.\n\nLet's get started!",

You'll avoid downtown and the highway, while still exploring some of Oakdale's hidden gems.

Based on your 5K time, we can estimate your lactate threshold pace, which is a good indicator of your endurance performance.\n\nUsing a running calculator, we can estimate your lactate threshold pace based on your 5K time. Plugging in your 26:30 5K time, we get:\n\n* Lactate threshold pace: approximately 8:45-9:00 min/mile\n* Estimated 10K performance: around 53-55 minutes\n\nThis is great news! Your 5K performance suggests you're already capable of maintaining a strong pace, and with the training plan I provided, you should be able to reach your goal of finishing the 10K in under 55 minutes.\n\nConsidering your 5K performance, we can also adjust the training plan to be more challenging and tailored to your abilities. We can increase the intensity and volume of your workouts, especially during the speed development and pace development phases.\n\nFor example, during the speed development phase, we could aim for 6-8 x 800m at 8:15-8:30 min/mile pace, with 400m active recovery in between. This will help you build even more speed and endurance.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and your actual 10K performance may vary depending on various factors, such as course terrain, weather conditions, and your overall training and recovery.
