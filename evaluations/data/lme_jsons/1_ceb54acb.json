A shorter term you could use to describe these behaviors is \"sexual compulsions.\" This term implies a pattern of behavior that is driven by an intense urge or need that is difficult to control, and which may interfere with an individual's daily life and relationships.",

Sexual fixations - This term implies a strong preoccupation with sexual thoughts or behaviors that may interfere with other areas of life.\n2. Problematic sexual behaviors - This phrase is straightforward and describes behaviors that cause problems or difficulties in an individual's life.\n3. Sexual impulsivity - This term emphasizes the impulsive or compulsive nature of certain sexual behaviors and the difficulties individuals may face in controlling them.\n4. Compulsive sexuality - This phrase emphasizes the compulsive nature of certain sexual behaviors and the difficulties individuals may face in breaking free from them.\n\nI hope these suggestions are more helpful for you.",
