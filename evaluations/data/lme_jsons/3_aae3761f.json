The island's gentle waves and variety of rental shops make it an ideal spot for trying out different water activities. Additionally, the more lively downtown area offers a bit more in terms of dining and nightlife options, which might be nice for a relaxed evening out.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for an even more secluded and peaceful experience, with a stronger focus on nature and wildlife, Chincoteague Island might still be the perfect fit for you.

The island has a lot to offer, and it's a great way to break up the drive to Tybee Island.\n\nYou're right, the seafood on Topsail Island is amazing, and you'll find plenty of restaurants serving up fresh catches of the day. Some popular spots include The Fish Factory, The Shrimp Haus, and The Beach Shop & Grill. Be sure to try some of the local specialties, like shrimp and grits or fish tacos.\n\nAfter lunch, take a short walk on the beach to stretch your legs and enjoy the ocean views. The beaches on Topsail Island are beautiful and relatively quiet, even during peak season. You might even spot some surfers catching waves or dolphins playing in the surf.\n\nAs you mentioned, Topsail Island is not too far out of the way, so it won't add too much time to your overall trip. From the Outer Banks, it's about a 2-hour drive to Topsail Island, and then another 4-5 hours to Tybee Island from there. So, you'll still have plenty of time to enjoy the rest of your drive and arrive at your destination in the afternoon.\n\nJust a tip: Be sure to check the tide times and plan your beach walk accordingly. The beaches on Topsail Island can get narrow during high tide, so you'll want to time your visit to coincide with low tide for the best experience.\n\nEnjoy your stop on Topsail Island, and I'm sure you'll have a great time stretching your legs and refueling for the rest of your drive to Tybee Island!",

The bad news is that The Fish Factory doesn't have outdoor seating with direct ocean views. The restaurant is located on the sound side of the island, so while you won't have ocean views, you'll still be able to enjoy the scenic views of the marshes and the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe good news is that The Fish Factory does have a large outdoor deck area where you can enjoy your meal. The deck is covered, so you'll be protected from the sun or any unexpected rain showers. While you won't have ocean views, the deck area is still a great spot to relax and take in the laid-back atmosphere of the island.\n\nIf you're really set on having ocean views with your lunch, you might consider checking out some other restaurants on the island that have outdoor seating with ocean views. One option could be the Ocean's Edge Restaurant at the Topsail Island Beach Club. They have a large outdoor deck with stunning ocean views, and their menu features a variety of seafood options, including platters and sandwiches.\n\nHowever, if you're still interested in trying The Fish Factory, I'd recommend giving them a call ahead of time to see if they have any outdoor seating available. They might have some tables with partial views of the marshes or the waterway, which could still be a nice spot to enjoy your meal.\n\nHope this helps, and I'm sure you'll find a great spot to enjoy your lunch on Topsail Island!",
