Here's a brief breakdown to consider:\n\n**Phone Call:**\n\n* A phone call allows for a more personal and conversational tone, which can be great for catching up and having a more in-depth discussion.\n* You can ask follow-up questions and have a more dynamic conversation.\n* It shows you're willing to take the time to talk to him directly.\n\n**LinkedIn Message:**\n\n* A LinkedIn message is a more casual and low-key approach, which can be beneficial if Alex is busy or prefers written communication.\n* You can send a brief message to check in and ask about his job search, and he can respond at his convenience.\n* LinkedIn is a professional platform, so it's a great way to keep the conversation focused on his career and job search.\n\nConsidering you're checking in on his job search, I'd recommend sending a LinkedIn message first. This allows Alex to respond when he's available, and you can keep the conversation focused on his career goals. If you want to have a more in-depth conversation, you can always follow up with a phone call later.\n\nHere's an example of a LinkedIn message you could send:\n\n\"Hi Alex, hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in and see how your job search is going. Have you had any promising leads or interviews recently? Let me know if there's anything I can do to help or if you'd like to catch up and discuss your progress.\"\n\nIf you do decide to call Alex, make sure to consider his schedule and preferences. You might want to send a brief message beforehand to ask if he's available for a call.\n\nWhich approach do you think you'll take?",
