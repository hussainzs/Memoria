The castle offers a more comprehensive understanding of the region's history, architecture, and cultural significance.\n\nThat being said, if you have time, Zenko-ji Temple is still worth a visit. The temple's peaceful atmosphere and beautiful gardens make it a great place to unwind and reflect on your day. If you can fit it in, try to visit the temple in the late afternoon or early evening, when the sun is setting, and the atmosphere is even more serene.\n\nRemember to take your time and enjoy the scenic views, traditional architecture, and cultural experiences that Matsumoto has to offer!",
