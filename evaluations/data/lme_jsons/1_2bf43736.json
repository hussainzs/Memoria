He also emphasizes the importance of prayer and the sacraments, particularly confession and the Eucharist, in the purgative way.\n\nThroughout the chapter, Tanqueray draws on the teachings of various spiritual writers, including St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila, to support his arguments. He also emphasizes the importance of perseverance in the purgative way, as the process of purification can be long and difficult.\n\nOverall, the second chapter of the first book of the second part of Tanqueray's Spiritual Life treatise provides an introduction to the purgative way and its importance in the spiritual life, and it lays the foundation for the rest of the book's exploration of the different stages of purification.",

However, he also emphasizes that even beginners can engage in simple forms of meditation, such as reflecting on a passage from Scripture or a particular aspect of God's nature.\n\nThroughout the chapter, Tanqueray emphasizes the importance of regular prayer and discipline in the spiritual life. He recommends setting aside specific times for prayer, and suggests using a prayer book or other resource to help structure one's prayer time.
