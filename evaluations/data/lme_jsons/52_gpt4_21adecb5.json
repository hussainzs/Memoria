        "content": "Saffron can be a bit tricky to find, but don't worry, I've got you covered.\n\n**Where to buy saffron:**\n\n1. **Specialty spice stores:** Look for stores that specialize in Middle Eastern, Indian, or Spanish cuisine. They usually carry high-quality saffron threads.\n2. **Gourmet markets:** Upscale grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or gourmet markets often carry saffron in their spice or international sections.\n3. **Online spice retailers:** You can find saffron online at retailers like Amazon, Penzeys Spices, The Spice House, or Sahadi's.\n4. **Some well-stocked supermarkets:** Some larger supermarkets like Kroger or Safeway might carry saffron in their international or gourmet sections.\n\n**What to look for when buying saffron:**\n\n* High-quality saffron threads should be deep red-orange in color and have a strong, sweet, earthy aroma.\n* Avoid saffron powder, as it can be adulterated with other spices or fillers. Threads are a better indicator of quality and potency.\n* Check the packaging for the country of origin (e.g., Spain, Iran, or Kashmir). Spanish saffron (Crocus sativus) is considered to be of high quality.\n\n**Substitutes for saffron:**\n\nWhile there's no perfect substitute for saffron, you can use the following alternatives in a pinch:\n\n* **Turmeric:** This will give your drink a yellow color, but it won't replicate the unique flavor and aroma of saffron. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder for every 1/2 teaspoon of saffron called for in the recipe.\n* **Paprika:** Similar to turmeric, paprika will add a smoky, slightly sweet flavor, but it won't have the same depth as saffron. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika for every 1/2 teaspoon of saffron.\n* **Annatto seeds:** These seeds have a slightly sweet, nutty flavor and a yellow-orange color. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of annatto seeds for every 1/2 teaspoon of saffron.\n\nKeep in mind that these substitutes won't provide the same luxurious, exotic flavor and aroma as saffron, so if you can, try to find the real deal.\n\nIf you're new to working with saffron, start with a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon) to ensure you're comfortable with the flavor and aroma. You can always adjust the amount to your taste in future recipes.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to try out the Saffron Gin Fizz!"

Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Sarsaparilla Bitters**: These bitters have a sweet, slightly spicy, and herbal flavor profile that complements gin nicely. Try pairing them with a London Dry Gin and a citrus-forward cocktail.\n2. **Yuzu Bitters**: Yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit, adds a fascinating flavor dimension to gin cocktails. These bitters will introduce a bright, citrusy, and slightly sweet flavor to your drinks.\n3. **Cardamom Bitters**: Cardamom's sweet, spicy, and herbal flavors work harmoniously with gin. Use them in a cocktail with a botanical-forward gin and a sweetener like honey or sugar.\n4. **Cherry Blossom Bitters**: These bitters capture the delicate, floral flavor of cherry blossoms. They pair nicely with a Plymouth Gin and a fruit-forward cocktail, like a Cherry Gin Fizz.\n5. **Smoked Hickory Bitters**: For a smoky, savory flavor, try these bitters with a robust, juniper-forward gin. They're perfect for a Smoked Gin Old Fashioned or a Gin-Gin Mule.\n6. **Celery Bitters**: Yes, you read that right! Celery bitters add a fresh, herbal flavor that complements gin's botanicals. Use them in a classic Gin & Tonic or a Celery-Gin Fizz.\n7. **Grapefruit-Scallion Bitters**: These bitters combine the brightness of grapefruit with the pungency of scallions. They're perfect for a Grapefruit-Gin Fizz or a savory Gin-Grapefruit Martini.\n8. **Black Truffle Bitters**: For a luxurious, earthy flavor, try these bitters with a rich, complex gin. They're ideal for a Black Truffle Negroni or a Gin-Truffle Martini.\n\nSome popular brands that offer these unique bitters include:\n\n* The Bitter Truth\n* Bittercube\n* The Bitter End\n* Fee Brothers\n* House of Botanicals\n\nRemember, when working with new bitters, start with a small amount (about 2-3 dashes) and adjust to taste.

Here are some ingredients that would complement the cardamom bitters nicely:\n\n1. **Gin-based whiskey:** A whiskey with a gin-like flavor profile, such as a botanical-forward bourbon or a genever, would pair beautifully with cardamom bitters.\n2. **Orange liqueur:** Cardamom and orange are a classic combination in many Indian desserts. Adding a small amount of orange liqueur, like Cointreau or Grand Marnier, will enhance the citrus notes and create a harmonious balance.\n3. **Honey syrup:** A touch of honey syrup (1:1 honey and water) will add a subtle sweetness and complement the spicy, herbal flavors of the cardamom bitters.\n4. **Dried fruit:** A dried fruit, like cranberries or cherries, can add a fruity and sweet contrast to the savory cardamom flavors. Muddle the fruit in the simple syrup or use it as a garnish.\n5. **Spiced cherry:** A spiced cherry, like a cherry infused with cinnamon, cloves, or allspice, will complement the warm, spicy flavors of the cardamom bitters.\n\nHere's a recipe to get you started:\n\n**Cardamom Old Fashioned**\n\n* 2 oz gin-based whiskey\n* 1/2 oz orange liqueur\n* 1/2 oz honey syrup\n* 2 dashes cardamom bitters\n* Orange peel (optional, for garnish)\n* Dried fruit or spiced cherry (optional, for garnish)\n\nIn a mixing glass, combine whiskey, orange liqueur, and honey syrup.

        "content": "Making your own flavored syrups is a great way to elevate your cocktails and add a personal touch! I'm happy to share some tips on how to make a good flavored syrup:\n\n1. **Choose a base syrup:** You can use a simple syrup (1:1 sugar and water) or a rich syrup (2:1 sugar and water) as your base. Rich syrup is thicker and more concentrated, so it's perfect for flavors that need a stronger presence.\n2. **Select your flavor ingredient:** Pick a flavor ingredient that complements your desired flavor profile. This could be fruits, herbs, spices, tea, or even coffee. Make sure it's fresh and of high quality.\n3. **Infusion method:** There are two common methods:\n\t* **Hot infusion:** Steep the flavor ingredient in hot water (around 180°F to 190°F) for 10-30 minutes. This method is ideal for delicate flavors like fruits and herbs.\n\t* **Cold infusion:** Steep the flavor ingredient in cold water for several hours or overnight. This method is better for more robust flavors like spices and roots.\n4. **Ratio and proportions:** Experiment with different ratios of flavor ingredient to syrup. A general starting point is 1 part flavor ingredient to 2 parts syrup.\n5. **Strain and filter:** Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove solids and sediment. If desired, filter the syrup through a coffee filter or paper towels for a clearer syrup.\n6. **Storage:** Store your flavored syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will typically last for 2-4 weeks.\n7. **Taste and adjust:** Taste the syrup and adjust the flavor to your liking. You can add more sugar, water, or flavor ingredient to achieve the desired balance.\n\nSome popular flavored syrups for cocktails include:\n\n* Fruit syrups (e.g., raspberry, strawberry, orange)\n* Herbal syrups (e.g., mint, basil, lemongrass)\n* Spiced syrups (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger)\n* Tea syrups (e.g., earl grey, green tea, chai)\n* Nut syrups (e.g., almond, hazelnut, pecan)\n\nFor your Cardamom Old Fashioned, you can try making a cardamom-honey syrup by infusing crushed cardamom pods in a hot honey syrup (1:1 honey and water) for 10-15 minutes. Strain and filter the syrup, then store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n\nRemember to always label and date your syrups, so you can keep track of their flavor profiles and shelf life. Happy syrup-making!"

The summer months from June to August are the most popular with tourists, as the weather is milder and the daylight hours are longer, giving you more time to enjoy the sights. However, this is also the busiest time of year, which means higher prices and larger crowds.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the Northern Lights, the best time to visit Iceland is during the winter months from December to February. These months also bring shorter daylight hours and colder temperatures, but the snow-covered landscapes are beautiful and there are fewer tourists.\n\nFor hiking and outdoor adventures, May and September are good months to visit Iceland, as the weather is mild, the crowds are smaller, and the prices are lower.\n\nOverall, no matter what time of year you visit, it's important to pack warm and waterproof clothing, as the weather in Iceland can be unpredictable and extreme, with strong winds, rain, and snow throughout the year."

You can choose from several rental companies that offer a range of vehicles, including campers and 4x4s for off-road adventures. However, make sure you are familiar with driving in Iceland, as the weather and road conditions can be challenging.\n- Taking tours is another great way to explore Iceland's natural wonders, especially if you want to learn more about the places you are visiting. There are many tour companies that offer day trips, guided tours, and multi-day excursions to different parts of the country.\n- If you're on a budget, consider camping or staying in hostels instead of hotels, as accommodation in Iceland can be expensive. Be sure to make reservations in advance, especially during peak tourist season.\n- Pack light and dress in layers, as the weather in Iceland can change quickly and drastically. Bring waterproof and windproof clothing, sturdy hiking shoes, and a hat and gloves.\n- Plan your itinerary in advance and try to avoid overbooking yourself.

They use various techniques like building houses with insulated walls and roofs to keep heat inside, and also equip them with wind deflectors so that the snow doesn't accumulate on the roof. The majority of the population has access to geothermal heat to keep their homes warm and electricity to power them. Additionally, Iceland has a well-developed infrastructure that ensures power outages are rare, and if they do occur, they are fixed quickly. Emergency services like search and rescue teams are also trained to respond to extreme conditions, such as volcanic eruptions, avalanches, or flash floods, which can happen in Iceland. Overall, while Iceland's weather can be challenging, the country is well-prepared to tackle it."

Injury has curtailed my marathon running journey so I have transferred into cycling. Music bingo is also something else I love to do given my love of music and collecting vinyl. My favourite things to do always involve my friends. Whether that be going to the pool or simply just playing card games, the most enjoyment I get in life comes from spending time with my friends.\n\nWho do you look up to (or admire)? And please explain.\nSir Bobby Charlton and all the other members of the 1958 Munich Disaster. My favourite soccer team is Manchester United and for me, it wasn't enough to follow the team at the present time. I dived into the history of the club and the foundations that led to where the club is today. The 1958 Munich Disaster was a seminal moment in the club's history. A plane carrying the team crashed on the runway trying to take off and most of the team was killed and the few survivors were severely injured. For those who did survive, a couple like Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Gregg helped carry other team members from the wreckage. A short time later Sir Bobby returned to play for a makeshift Manchester United Team. He was the keystone in the rebuilding of the team who went on to win the 1968 European Cup, the most respected trophy in club football. Sir Bobby Charlton is Manchester United and he represents everything that is great about the club, his greatness in all areas is legendary.\n\nAdam Day is someone I greatly admire as well. He is one of the coaching staff with the Canadian Women's National Soccer Team and was at the Whitecaps when I was a part of their residency program. He has been a real rock in an environment that is extremely hectic and intense. The ability to perform his job at the highest level while also not losing the sense of fun and enjoyment that one should bring to a team environment. When things got tough in camp with the national team, he was always there to help out or be my support system. In a place full of ego and expectation, Adam was the one that would ground everyone and remind them that fun and performance are not mutually exclusive.\n\nWhat was your first job and how old were you when you had that job?\nI was a referee and linesman for soccer games and I started doing this when I was 12 or 13 years old.\n\nWhat do you like most about your most recent place of Employment?\nEveryone's opinion is respected and heard.\n\nWhat do you like least about your most recent place of Employment\nIt can be hard for certain people to commit to meeting times.\n\nWhat is something you would be happy doing everyday for the rest of your career?\nlearning.\n\nWhat do you feel is your greatest strength?\nadaptability.\n\nWhat do you feel is your greatest weakness?\nI can take criticism personally. because I then feel like I have let people down\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone (dead or alive) who would it be and why?\nEric Cantona, because he was the springboard for Manchester United's success in from the early 90's until now. He is an enigmatic man who is multi-layered and I feel like he would have interesting opinions on a vast array of topics.\n\nWhat advice would you give to society to make it better?\nEverybody is going through something, whether big or small."

Transparency and Traceability: The blockchain provides a shared database that cannot be altered, making it easier to track products and materials as they move through the supply chain. Each transaction is recorded and verified, resulting in increased transparency and traceability.\n\n2. Faster Payments: Blockchain technology can help speed up the payment process by eliminating the middlemen and reducing the time and costs associated with transaction settlements.\n\n3. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing agreements programmed with specific terms and conditions. They can be used in supply chain management to automate the execution of contracts between parties, reducing the need for intermediaries and streamlining the process.\n\n4. Reduced Fraud: Blockchain technology can help prevent fraud by providing an immutable digital record of all transactions. This reduces the chance of tampering or altering data, making it more secure than traditional paper-based systems.\n\n5. Improved Logistics: Blockchain technology can provide real-time tracking and monitoring of goods and materials in the supply chain. This can help companies optimize their logistics and improve efficiency by identifying areas of the supply chain that need improvement.\n\nOverall, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management by providing a secure and transparent platform for tracking products and materials through the entire supply chain."

        "content": "Blockchain technology ensures the security and accuracy of data in the supply chain in several ways:\n\n1. Decentralization: Blockchain operates on the concept of decentralization, meaning that there is no central authority controlling the network. Instead, participants in the network have copies of the same shared ledger, and every transaction is verified by the network, making it nearly impossible to hack or manipulate the system.\n\n2. Immutable Ledger: The ledger is an immutable record of all transactions, meaning that once a record has been added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This provides a high degree of security, as records are tamper-proof, and once data is entered, there is no way to change it.\n\n3. Verification: All transactions on the blockchain are verified by the network using complex algorithms, which ensure that the transactions are accurate and legit. This reduces the potential for fraud or manipulation.\n\n4. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are programmed to execute specific conditions. These contracts help to ensure that transactions are executed transparently, securely, and with a high degree of accuracy.\n\n5. Confidentiality: Confidentiality is provided through the use of encryption, ensuring that sensitive information is not accessible by unauthorized parties.\n\nIn summary, blockchain technology ensures the security and accuracy of data in the supply chain through its decentralized operation, its immutable ledger, its verification mechanisms, its use of smart contracts, and its confidentiality measures."

High Energy Consumption: Blockchain networks require significant computing power to operate, which can result in high energy consumption. The high energy consumption can lead to increased costs, environmental concerns and hinder scalability.\n\n2. Complexity: Blockchain technology can be complex and challenging to implement, especially in large-scale supply chain operations. The technical complexities may require specialized expertise and can slow down adoption if not correctly implemented.\n\n3. Standardization and Interoperability: The lack of standardization and interoperability between different blockchain networks is a significant hurdle. This makes it challenging, if not impossible, for different parties in the supply chain to communicate with each other efficiently, which hampers scalability.\n\n4. Data Privacy: While the blockchain offers transparency, some companies might be hesitant to share sensitive data on a public network, especially in cases where data privacy is a concern.\n\n5. Cost: Although the technology is in wide use across the supply chain, implementing blockchain incurs additional cost, including the need to maintain a shared data infrastructure apart from any other technology costs.\n\nOverall, the drawbacks of using blockchain in the supply chain are primarily related to technical hurdles, and new innovations and advancements are continuing to address these limitations. As the technology evolves to handle new challenges, it is expected that these drawbacks will decrease over time."

        "content": "Several cultural barriers have hindered the preservation of the Kiowa language, including historical trauma, forced assimilation, and the acculturation of younger generations. In the late 1800s, the U.S. government forced indigenous peoples onto reservations and established boarding schools where they were not allowed to speak their native languages. This caused Kiowa children to be removed from their families and communities, leading to intergenerational trauma and a disconnection from their language and culture.\n\nFurthermore, as English became the dominant language of the United States, younger generations of Kiowa speakers began to shift away from their native language in favor of English in order to assimilate and succeed in a predominantly English-speaking society. This has led to a decline in the number of Kiowa speakers and further challenges in preserving the language.\n\nEfforts to overcome these barriers include language revitalization programs and cultural preservation initiatives. The Kiowa Tribe has developed language immersion programs in schools, online learning resources, and language preservation workshops to encourage the transfer of the Kiowa language to younger generations. Additionally, elders and native speakers have developed dictionaries and written materials to aid in language acquisition and preservation efforts. Overall, community efforts to revive and preserve the Kiowa language have been vital in overcoming cultural barriers to sustain the language for future generations."

The Tribunal dealt with the 19 July 2017 letter as one part of a course of conduct (which included the builder’s correspondence) that led the Tribunal to conclude that there was an agreement between the parties. Furthermore, we note that in its post-hearing submissions the builder did not specifically cite Butler v Fairclough. Rather, it cited Haller, which the Tribunal in turn cited at [20] of the Reasons. The Tribunal was not obliged to give any more detailed reasons than were provided.\nGrounds 6 and 7 - Completion date\nThe issues to be considered in respect of these grounds are whether the Tribunal made an error of law in finding that the completion date of the works undertaken pursuant to the parties’ 2009 contract was 20 October 2010 (Ground 6). This ground involves the proper construction of the contract, which is a question of law. Leave to appeal is not required in respect of Ground 6.\nThe issue in Ground 7 is whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal’s finding concerning the completion date was against the weight of evidence.\nTribunal’s finding\nIn relation to completion date, the Tribunal stated:\nThe owners argued that practical completion under the original contract took place on 20 October 2010 when the FOC issued. I agree respectfully with the thrust of the owners' submission in this respect. The \"building works\" as defined in cl 1.1 of the original contract meant \"the building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations\" (emphasis added), \"contract documents\" meant the general and special conditions and the plans, the specifications and other documents specified in Item 14 of Schedule 1, Sch 1 headed \"Particulars of Contracts\" was part of the contract, Sch 1 para 11 said that the builder was the person to obtain and pay for all planning and building approvals (which was the default position if a party was not, unlike here, expressly named), clause 7.1 said that the party named in item 11 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals, which necessarily included them in the contract price, the FOC is a planning and building approval because it approves lawful occupation on the basis of conformity of the physical structure with preceding approvals, and cll 26.2(c) to 26.7 with cl 15 required the final progress claim out of the contract price to be demanded and paid on, and only on, practical completion.\nMoreover, as a further but not necessary supporting basis for the conclusion, the first emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" indicate that the physical works are of no use to the owner to possess, even if physical possession of them is given by giving of keys, unless they are legally approved for occupation by the owner. This last point is reinforced by the definition in cl 1.1 of \"practical completion\" which focuses on completeness except for matters not preventing use for usual purpose; such use cannot be present without the approval to occupy.\nFinally, and as a further but not necessary supporting argument, the second emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" arguably cover the written variation to the original contract constituted by the terms of the builder's letter, although I note that I have \nPlease write in English language."

The Tribunal relied on the definition of \"building works\" in the contract, which included \"completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\" The Tribunal also noted that the FOC was a planning and building approval that allowed lawful occupation of the building and that the contract required the final progress claim to be paid only on practical completion.\n\nIn relation to Ground 6, the Tribunal's conclusion about the completion date is a question of law, and leave to appeal is not required. As for Ground 7, the builder argues that the Tribunal's finding about the completion date was against the weight of evidence. However, the reasons provided by the Tribunal for its finding indicate that it properly considered the evidence, and the builder has not identified any errors in the Tribunal's approach.

The builder's obligations under the contract (irrespective of the definition and meaning of \"building works\", \"date of practical completion\" and \"practical completion\") were not complete at least until the owners received the FOC as part of planning and building approvals under item 11 in Sch 1; that provides the date that work is complete within the meaning of the original contract (a date is not required, just a specified activity) on the proper interpretation of the contract and also within the meaning of HBA s 3B(1). Accordingly, s 3B(2) and (3) have no work to do because s 3B(2) operates when s 3B(1) is not operative and s 3B(3) is parasitic on s 3B(2) because it requires a context of practical completion for the presumption about practical completion to operate.\nConclusion on grounds 6 and 7\nIn summary, the Tribunal’s reasoning process in relation to completion date was:\nThe builder was responsible for obtaining the FOC;\nThe builder’s obligation to provide the FOC fell within the definition of “building works” under the contract\nCompletion of the works occurred within the meaning of the contract and therefore for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners’ receipt of the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC);\nThe Tribunal’s finding in this respect is relevant to its finding that there was consideration in respect of the new contract it found that the parties had entered into. Given our findings in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, it is not strictly necessary for us to consider this ground, but we do so for completeness.\nWe conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of relevant terms of the contract.\nFor this purpose we set out the relevant clauses of the contract, which is a standard form Housing Industry Association (HIA) contract.\nClause 1 of the contract defines “building works” as:\nThe building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations.\nIn accordance with clause 1, “practical completion” means:\nWhen the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose.\nClause 7 of the contract is headed “Planning and Building Approvals”. Clause 7.1states:\n7.1 The party named in Item 11 of Schedule 1 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals.\nItem 11 names the builder as the responsible party for the purposes of clause 7.\nPlease write in English language."

The definition of “building works” is clear and refers to physical works, including variations. The FOC, while a crucial component of obtaining planning and building approvals, is not part of the physical works themselves. Clause 7.1 of the contract places the responsibility for obtaining and paying for all building and planning approvals on the builder, but this does not mean that the obtaining of approvals is part of the building works themselves.\nWe also do not accept the Tribunal’s finding that completion of the works occurred for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners’ receipt of the FOC. The definition of “practical completion” in the contract specifically provides that the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The receipt of the FOC is not necessary for the building works to be reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. While the FOC is a necessary component of obtaining planning and building approvals, it is not a necessary component of practical completion of the building works themselves.\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the contract in finding that the completion date of the works was 20 October 2010. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider Ground 7.\nOrders\nFor the reasons given above, we make the following orders:\n\n1. The appeal is allowed in part.\n2. The orders made by the Tribunal on 16 March 2020 are set aside.\n3. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.\n4. The owners are to pay the builder’s costs of the appeal."

        "content": "There are many factors that contribute to the cost of insuring a vehicle. While it is difficult to provide exact figures for each specific situation, I can provide a qualitative analysis of the factors you mentioned and how they might affect the cost of insurance in 2021.\n\n1. Driver's address: Insurance rates vary by location due to differences in population density, crime rates, accident rates, and other factors. San Francisco and San Diego, both in California, may have higher insurance rates compared to St. Louis, Missouri, due to the higher cost of living and higher population density in California cities.\n2. Car mileage: Vehicles with higher mileage (e.g., 80,000 miles) generally have higher insurance rates than those with lower mileage (e.g., 20,000 miles), as higher mileage can increase the likelihood of mechanical issues and accidents.\n3. Model year of the vehicle: Newer vehicles (e.g., 2020) generally have higher insurance rates due to their higher value compared to older vehicles (e.g., 2010). However, some older vehicles may have higher rates if they lack modern safety features.\n4. Car model: The type of vehicle can greatly impact insurance rates. A hybrid vehicle may have lower rates due to its environmentally friendly nature and lower repair costs. A Mercedes, a luxury car, would likely have higher rates due to its higher value and potentially higher repair costs. A Suburban, being a large SUV, might also have higher rates due to its size and potential damage it could cause in an accident.\n5. Age of the driver: Insurance rates typically decrease with age, as older drivers are considered more experienced and less likely to be involved in accidents. A 68-year-old driver would likely have lower rates compared to a 32-year-old driver.\n6. Expected mileage per year: Higher annual mileage (e.g., 38,000 miles) can lead to higher insurance rates, as it increases the likelihood of accidents and wear on the vehicle.\n7. Insurance company: Rates can vary significantly between insurance companies. More economical companies may offer lower rates, while more expensive companies may have higher rates for similar coverage.\n8. Years as a customer of the insurance company: Long-term customers (e.g., 20 years) may receive loyalty discounts, which can reduce insurance rates compared to newer customers (e.g., 5 years).\n9. Financing: Leased or financed vehicles may require more comprehensive insurance coverage, which can increase rates compared to vehicles purchased with cash.\n10. Vehicle usage: Insurance rates may be lower for vehicles used purely for leisure, as they are driven less frequently and are less likely to be involved in accidents compared to vehicles used for professional purposes or daily commutes.\n11. Driving history: A driver with a clean driving record (e.g., 30 years with no traffic violations) will typically have lower insurance rates compared to drivers with a history of violations or accidents.\n12. Demographic discounts: Some insurance companies offer discounts for certain demographics, such as students, military personnel, or senior citizens. These discounts can vary by company and eligibility criteria.\n13. Other insurance policies: Bundling multiple insurance policies (e.g., home and auto) with the same company can lead to discounts on both policies. Insuring multiple family members or vehicles with the same company may also result in lower rates."

Over the years, Adidas has released several iterations of the Ultraboost, each with its own unique features and updates. Here's a breakdown of the main differences between the Ultraboost 21 and 22:\n\n**Ultraboost 21:**\n\n* Released in 2021, the Ultraboost 21 is a significant update to the previous 20 series.\n* Features a new, more responsive midsole material called \"Boost 2.0,\" which provides a softer and more responsive ride.\n* The upper is made of a lightweight, Primeknit material that provides a snug, sock-like fit.\n* The heel counter is more substantial and supportive than previous models, providing a more secure fit.\n* The outsole features a Continental Rubber compound for improved traction and durability.\n* Weight: Approximately 10.2 oz (289g) for men's size 9.\n\n**Ultraboost 22:**\n\n* Released in 2022, the Ultraboost 22 builds upon the success of the 21, with some key updates.\n* Features an updated midsole design with a more pronounced \"window\" in the heel, allowing for more Boost material and increased energy return.\n* The upper features a new \"PRIMEKNIT 2.0\" material, which is lighter, more breathable, and provides an even more precise fit.\n* The heel counter is slightly more relaxed than the 21, providing a more comfortable fit for runners with narrower heels.\n* The outsole features a new, more aggressive tread pattern for improved traction on various surfaces.\n* Weight: Approximately 10.5 oz (298g) for men's size 9.\n\n**Key differences between Ultraboost 21 and 22:**\n\n* The 22 has a more substantial and responsive midsole, with a more pronounced \"window\" in the heel for increased Boost material and energy return.\n* The 22's upper is lighter and more breathable, with a more precise fit.\n* The 22's heel counter is slightly more relaxed, providing a more comfortable fit for runners with narrower heels.\n* The 22's outsole has a more aggressive tread pattern for improved traction.\n\n**Other Ultraboost models:**\n\n* **Ultraboost X**: A more supportive and stable version of the Ultraboost, designed for runners with higher arches or those who need more support.\n* **Ultraboost ST**: A more stripped-down, lightweight version of the Ultraboost, designed for speed and efficiency.\n* **Ultraboost LTD**: A limited-edition version of the Ultraboost, often featuring unique colorways and designs.\n\nWhen choosing between the Ultraboost 21 and 22, consider the following:\n\n* If you prefer a more supportive and stable ride, the 21 might be the better choice.\n* If you prefer a more responsive and energetic ride, the 22 might be the better choice.\n* If you have narrower heels, the 22's more relaxed heel counter might provide a more comfortable fit.\n\nUltimately, both the Ultraboost 21 and 22 are excellent choices, and you can't go wrong with either one. I recommend trying them on and going for a run or doing some exercises to see which one feels more comfortable and suitable for your needs."

        "content": "Trying on both the Ultraboost 21 and 22 is a great idea to see which one feels more comfortable for you.\n\nRegarding Terra shoes, they're actually a great choice for outdoor activities like trail running, hiking, and walking. However, they might not be the best option for high-impact activities like road running or track running.\n\nTerra shoes are designed for off-road adventures, and they excel in providing excellent grip, traction, and protection on uneven terrain. They typically feature more aggressive tread patterns, higher ankle collars, and a more substantial build to handle rough conditions.\n\nWhile Terra shoes can be comfortable for shorter, casual runs or jogging, they might not provide the same level of cushioning, support, and energy return as a dedicated running shoe like the Ultraboost. Here's why:\n\n* **Cushioning**: Terra shoes often have a more substantial and firmer midsole to handle rough terrain, which can make them less comfortable for high-impact activities like running on hard surfaces.\n* **Support**: Terra shoes might not provide the same level of arch support and stability as a running shoe, which can lead to fatigue and discomfort during longer runs.\n* **Weight**: Terra shoes are often heavier than running shoes, which can affect your running efficiency and endurance.\n\nIf you're planning to use your Terra shoes for running, I'd recommend the following:\n\n* Start with shorter, easier runs (3-5 km) to see how your feet and legs respond to the shoes.\n* Pay attention to your form and try to land midfoot or forefoot instead of heel striking, as this can help reduce the impact on your joints.\n* Consider using orthotics or insoles to provide additional support and cushioning.\n* Gradually increase your running distance and intensity to allow your body to adapt to the shoes.\n\nHowever, if you're serious about running and want to optimize your performance, I'd recommend investing in a dedicated running shoe like the Ultraboost. They're designed specifically for running and can provide better cushioning, support, and energy return to help you perform at your best.\n\nHope that helps, and happy running!"

        "content": "In the apartment above the settlement in Erethel, there lived a reclusive writer known as Theyla Keth. Though she went out among the people in her daily routine, donning a shawl and playing the role of an old woman to blend in, she preferred to spend most of her time alone with her robots and Richard Bot, who assisted her with her errands. She submitted her recordings to the Library branch and retreated to her home to recover from the effort.\n\nOne day, while she was at her desk, the walls shook, and she heard an aircraft landing on the roof of the mud brick apartment complex. Frustrated by the disturbance, she donned her hooded cloak and grabbed her walking stick to confront the intruder. However, when she stepped outside, she froze in shock as she saw Val Renberg standing before her, backlit by the sun.\n\nVal Renberg was not wearing her usual Co-Op flight suit or white and gold clothing, but rather plain brown leathers. Her angular face and severe hairstyle had remained the same, as had her dark green gaze and goggles pushed up onto her forehead. Theyla couldn't help but stare at her in disbelief. Val looked at her briefly and then away again, her lip quivering slightly as she spoke Theyla's name.\n\nTheyla trembled as Val took her hands and pulled her into a tight embrace. The touch of Val's hand made her heart race, and she was acutely aware of how vulnerable she was in her barefoot state. She could barely speak as Val held her, feeling her tears welling up as she breathed in Val's scent of sweat and leather.\n\nVal suggested they go inside, and Theyla led her back up the stairs to her apartment. They walked through the rooms as the evening light filled them, and Theyla showed Val the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and sitting room. Val followed her silently and nodded in understanding.\n\nWhen they sat down on the sofa in the living room, surrounded by piles of books and media, Theyla asked Val why she had come. Val revealed that she had quit DSES and cashed out her pension, staying at Novaya Waypoint while waiting for her hazard pay to cash out so she could buy a ship. She had come to see Theyla before she left.\n\nFinally, Val reached into her leather jacket and produced a small folded square of paper, setting it down on the table in front of them. It was the letter Theyla had written to Val, expressing her feelings and concerns before they had parted ways months ago. They had spent their last night together making love all night long, and Theyla had slipped the letter into Val's jacket pocket before she left, knowing she might never see her again.\n\nAs Theyla looked at the letter on the table, memories flooded her mind, and she struggled to contain her emotions. Val sat silently beside her, waiting for her to speak."

John Constable: Another British artist, Constable was a contemporary of Turner's and also focused on landscapes, often featuring serene and idyllic scenes of nature, including water.\n3.

He's known for his detailed and atmospheric depictions of waterfalls, lakes, and mountains.\n4. Georgia O'Keeffe: While not exclusively focused on water, O'Keeffe's work often features flowers, landscapes, and natural forms. Her abstracted, modernist style brought a fresh perspective to depicting the natural world.\n5. Mark Rothko: Although primarily an abstract artist, Rothko's work often evokes a sense of the sublime and the natural world. His color fields can be seen as echoing the colors and moods of nature, including water.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are countless other artists who have been inspired by water and nature.

Here are a few other examples of books that effectively use foreshadowing:\n\n1. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee: Foreshadowing is used throughout the novel to create a sense of tension and anticipation. For example, the reclusive Boo Radley is repeatedly mentioned, creating an air of mystery around his character and building towards his eventual appearance.\n\n2. \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Bronte: The novel uses foreshadowing to create a sense of impending danger and foreboding. For example, the foreboding atmosphere of the novel is set early on when Jane first sees a ghost-like figure in the red room.\n\n3. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" by Edgar Allan Poe: This short story is a classic example of how foreshadowing can be used to build suspense. The narrator's increasingly erratic behavior and obsession with the old man's eye create a sense of dread and anticipation in the reader.\n\n4. \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins: The novel uses foreshadowing to establish the brutal nature of the games and to hint at the dangers that await the characters. For example, the reapings and the violence of the games are foreshadowed in the early chapters of the book.\n\nThese are just a few examples of books that effectively use foreshadowing to enhance their narratives.

Guest profiling: Airbnb bans any forms of guest profiling which can give hosts information on a guest’s age, sex, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation that could lead to discrimination.\n\n2. Machine-learning models: Airbnb's machine-learning models analyze hosts' behavior patterns and customer reviews to identify suspicious cases of discrimination.\n\n3. Content moderation: Airbnb uses a team to review and moderate the messages sent between guests and hosts for language that appears discriminatory, such as derogatory remarks relating to race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.\n\n4. Anonymous bookings: Airbnb offers features, such as shared experiences that allow for anonymous bookings to protect guests from discrimination.\n\nWhile these measures cannot entirely eliminate discrimination, they can reduce the prevalence of discriminatory practices on the platform.

Here are some tips to help you clean your bike like a pro:\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n1. **Gather your cleaning supplies**:\n\t* A soft-bristled brush (like an old toothbrush)\n\t* A clean, soft cloth (microfiber or an old t-shirt)\n\t* A bike cleaner (you're already using one, great!)\n\t* A degreaser (optional, but recommended for the chain and gears)\n\t* Water\n\t* A clean, dry cloth for drying\n2. **Choose a well-ventilated area** to clean your bike, away from direct sunlight.\n\n**Cleaning steps:**\n\n1. **Remove any loose dirt and debris**: Use the soft-bristled brush to gently sweep away any loose dirt, leaves, or twigs from the frame, wheels, and other components.\n2. **Apply the bike cleaner**: Spray the bike cleaner onto the frame, wheels, and other components, following the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure to cover all surfaces evenly.\n3. **Let it sit**: Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes to penetrate and break down any tough grime.\n4. **Wipe down the frame and components**: Use the soft cloth to wipe down the frame, fork, and other components, working from top to bottom. Be gentle, as you don't want to scratch the paint or damage any components.\n5. **Clean the wheels and tires**: Use the brush to clean the wheels and tires, removing any dirt, grime, or brake dust.\n6. **Degrease the chain and gears (if necessary)**: If you have a chain-driven bike, use a degreaser to clean the chain and gears. Apply the degreaser to the chain and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, use a clean cloth to wipe away the grime and excess degreaser.\n7. **Rinse the bike (optional)**: If you live in an area with hard water or want to remove any remaining dirt, use a low-pressure hose to rinse the bike. Be careful not to spray water directly into any bearings or electrical components.\n8. **Dry the bike**: Use a clean, dry cloth to dry the bike, paying extra attention to any areas prone to water spots (like the wheels and chainrings).\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* **Avoid using high-pressure hoses**, which can damage bearings or force water into sensitive areas.\n* **Don't use harsh chemicals**, abrasive cleaners, or household cleaners, which can damage paint, anodizing, or other components.\n* **Clean your bike regularly** to prevent grime and dirt from building up.\n* **Lubricate your chain** after cleaning and drying to keep it running smoothly.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to keep your bike clean, well-maintained, and running smoothly. Happy commuting!"

Reaching 1000 miles by the end of summer is an achievable goal, and with a solid plan, you can stay motivated and crush it!\n\nHere are some tips to help you stay motivated and reach your goal:\n\n1. **Break your goal into smaller milestones**: Divide your goal into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, aim to ride 200 miles per month or 50 miles per week. This will make your goal feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment as you reach each milestone.\n2. **Create a routine**: Establish a regular riding schedule, whether it's daily, every other day, or a few times a week. Consistency is key to developing a habit and making progress towards your goal.\n3. **Vary your route**: Mix up your route to avoid boredom and keep things interesting. Explore new neighborhoods, trails, or bike paths to discover new sights and challenges.\n4. **Find a riding buddy**: Having someone to ride with can be a great motivator. You can encourage and support each other, share tips, and make the experience more enjoyable.\n5. **Track your progress**: Continue tracking your mileage, and consider using a cycling app or spreadsheet to monitor your progress. Seeing your numbers grow can be a great motivator.\n6. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for reaching certain milestones, like a new bike accessory, a post-ride coffee, or a celebratory dinner. This will give you something to look forward to and make the journey more enjoyable.\n7. **Focus on the benefits**: Remember why you started riding in the first place. Focus on the benefits of cycling, such as improved health, reduced stress, and increased energy. This will help you stay motivated and committed to your goal.\n8. **Be flexible**: Life can be unpredictable, and some days you might not feel like riding. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Instead, adjust your schedule and get back on track as soon as possible.\n9. **Celebrate your progress**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way. You've already clocked 347 miles, which is a great achievement! Recognize your hard work and use it as motivation to keep pushing forward.\n10. **Make it fun**: Most importantly, remember to enjoy the ride! Listen to music, take in the scenery, and appreciate the freedom and joy that comes with cycling.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to reaching your goal of 1000 miles by the end of summer.

But I can suggest a few ways to find a good bike shop in your area:\n\n1. **Ask for referrals**: Ask friends, family, or fellow cyclists for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights into their experiences with local bike shops.\n2. **Online reviews**: Check online review platforms like Yelp, Google, or Facebook to see what other customers have to say about local bike shops. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the reviews to get a sense of the shop's strengths and weaknesses.\n3. **Check with local cycling clubs or organizations**: Reach out to local cycling clubs, bike advocacy groups, or cycling events organizers for recommendations. They often have connections with reputable bike shops in the area.\n4. **Look for certified mechanics**: Look for bike shops with certified mechanics, such as those certified by the National Bicycle Dealers Association (NBDA) or the United Bicycle Institute (UBI). This ensures that the mechanics have the necessary training and expertise to work on your bike.\n5. **Check their website and social media**: Visit the bike shop's website and social media pages to get a sense of their services, pricing, and customer engagement.\n\nWhen you find a few promising shops, give them a call or visit them in person to ask questions like:\n\n* What services do they offer (e.g., tune-ups, repairs, custom builds)?\n* What's their experience with your type of bike (e.g., road, mountain, hybrid)?\n* What's their pricing and turnaround time for tune-ups?\n* Do they offer any warranties or guarantees on their work?\n\nBy doing your research and asking the right questions, you'll be able to find a reliable bike shop that meets your needs and helps you keep your bike in top condition."

Here are some insights based on various studies and Facebook's own recommendations:\n\n**Best times to go live on Facebook:**\n\n1. **Afternoon delight**: Just like you've observed, afternoons tend to be a sweet spot for Facebook Live engagement. Specifically, 12 pm - 3 pm EST ( Eastern Standard Time) seems to be a popular time slot. This might be because people are taking a break from work or school, and their lunch breaks coincide with this time frame.\n2. **Peak hours**: Facebook's own research suggests that peak hours for Facebook Live are between 12 pm - 4 pm EST, with a slight dip around 2 pm. This is likely due to the natural lull in engagement during the mid-afternoon slump.\n3. **Early evening**: 5 pm - 7 pm EST is another popular time slot, as people are wrapping up their workday and starting to unwind before dinner.\n4. **Weekdays**: Facebook Live engagement tends to be higher on weekdays (Monday to Thursday) compared to weekends. This might be because people are more likely to be active on Facebook during their lunch breaks or after work.\n5. **Avoid rush hour**: Try to avoid going live during rush hour (7 am - 9 am EST and 4 pm - 6 pm EST), as people are typically commuting or in transit during these times.\n\n**Additional factors to consider:**\n\n1. **Your audience's time zone**: If your target audience is primarily located in a specific time zone, consider scheduling your live sessions accordingly.\n2. **Your content's relevance**: If your content is more relevant to a specific time of day (e.g., a morning motivational session or an evening relaxation routine), schedule your live session accordingly.\n3. **Consistency**: Stick to a consistent schedule to build anticipation and expectation from your audience.\n4. **Experiment and adjust**: Analyze your Facebook Insights to determine which times work best for your specific audience and adjust your schedule accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the best time to go live on Facebook ultimately depends on your unique audience and their preferences. Continue to experiment and adjust your schedule based on your engagement metrics and audience feedback."

You might find that 2 pm on Tuesdays and 10 am on Thursdays work better than other times.\n2. **Create a content calendar**: Plan your content in advance and create a content calendar that takes into account your audience's preferences and your own goals.\n3. **Promote your live streams**: Make sure to promote your live streams on other social media channels, email newsletters, and your website to increase visibility and drive traffic to your Facebook page.\n4. **Analyze and adjust**: Continuously monitor your Facebook Insights and adjust your strategy based on the data.

Optimizing your camera settings for Facebook Live can make a huge difference in the quality of your streams and overall viewer experience. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your new camera:\n\n1. **Resolution and Frame Rate**: Facebook recommends a minimum resolution of 720p (1280x720) at 30 frames per second (fps). If your camera can handle it, consider shooting in 1080p (1920x1080) at 60 fps for a smoother and more detailed stream.\n2. **Bitrate**: A higher bitrate ensures a higher quality stream, but it also increases the file size and may cause buffering issues. Aim for a bitrate between 4500-9000 kbps for a good balance between quality and stability.\n3. **Aspect Ratio**: Facebook Live uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, so make sure your camera is set to this ratio to avoid black bars or cropping.\n4. **Field of View**: Experiment with different field of view settings to find the one that works best for your content. A wider field of view can be useful for tutorials or demonstrations, while a narrower field of view can be more flattering for talking-head style streams.\n5. **White Balance**: Set your white balance to match your lighting conditions. Auto white balance can work well, but you may need to adjust it if you're using a specific lighting setup.\n6. **Focus**: Make sure your camera is set to continuous autofocus (AF-C) or manual focus, and adjust the focus to ensure your face or subject is sharp.\n7. **Exposure**: Adjust the exposure to ensure your face or subject is well-lit. You can use the camera's built-in exposure compensation or adjust the brightness and contrast settings.\n8. **Audio**: Good audio quality is crucial for a successful Facebook Live stream. Use an external microphone whenever possible, and adjust the audio levels to ensure your voice is clear and crisp.\n9. **Stabilization**: If your camera has optical image stabilization (OIS) or electronic image stabilization (EIS), enable it to reduce camera shake and motion blur.\n10. **Camera Settings App**: Familiarize yourself with your camera's settings app or menu system. This will allow you to adjust settings quickly and easily during the stream.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* **Use a tripod**: A tripod will help reduce camera shake and ensure a steady shot.\n* **Invest in a lens filter**: A lens filter can help reduce glare, improve color accuracy, and add a professional touch to your streams.\n* **Monitor your stream**: Use a separate monitor or device to monitor your stream and adjust your camera settings as needed.\n* **Test and adjust**: Before going live, test your camera settings and adjust them as needed to ensure the best possible quality.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to optimize your camera settings for Facebook Live and deliver a high-quality stream that engages your audience."

Try to arrive early to beat the crowds.\n2. **Be Prepared for Crowds:** The market is bustling, so be prepared for narrow alleys and crowds.\n3. **Cash Only:** Many stalls and restaurants only accept cash, so have some yen handy.\n4. **Dress Comfortably:** Wear comfortable shoes and dress for the weather, as you'll be walking and standing for extended periods.\n5. **Respect the Vendors:** Remember to be respectful of the vendors and their products. Don't touch or handle the seafood, and avoid taking photos of the fish auction area.\n6. **Combine with Other Attractions:** Consider visiting the nearby Hamarikyu Gardens or taking a stroll along the Sumida River after exploring the outer market.\n\n**Getting There:**\n\nThe nearest station is Tsukiji-shijo Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line.

        "content": "The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (CAOS) is a unique blend of genres, making it hard to pin down. It's a dark, supernatural teen drama with elements of horror, fantasy, and satire. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Tone:** CAOS has a campy, self-aware tone, often poking fun at itself and the teen horror genre. It's not a straightforward horror show, but rather a show that uses horror elements to tell a story about identity, morality, and the struggles of adolescence.\n\n**Plot:** The show follows Sabrina Spellman, a half-witch, half-mortal teenager who's trying to navigate her dual identities. She's torn between her mortal life with her friends and family in Greendale and her witchy heritage in the mysterious and dark world of the witches.\n\n**Horror elements:** While CAOS has its share of jump scares, creepy atmospheres, and supernatural threats, it's not a traditional horror show. The horror elements are often used to serve the story and characters, rather than to simply shock or scare the audience.\n\n**Teen drama:** At its core, CAOS is a teen drama that explores themes of identity, friendship, love, and self-discovery. Sabrina's struggles to balance her mortal and witchy lives serve as a metaphor for the challenges many teenagers face in finding their place in the world.\n\n**Satire and social commentary:** The show also incorporates satirical elements, commenting on issues like patriarchy, toxic masculinity, and the darker aspects of American history. It's not afraid to tackle tough topics, but does so in a way that's engaging and thought-provoking.\n\n**Visuals and style:** CAOS has a distinct, stylized aesthetic, with a blend of retro and modern elements. The show's use of color, lighting, and production design creates a dreamlike atmosphere that's both captivating and unsettling.\n\n**Seasons:** 4 seasons (Parts 1-4) are currently available on Netflix, with a total of 36 episodes.\n\nIf you enjoy shows that blend genres, have a strong sense of style, and explore complex themes, you might enjoy The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Keep in mind that it's a show that's not afraid to take risks and push boundaries, so be prepared for some unexpected twists and turns!"

Canceling cable and switching to a streaming-only plan can be a great way to save money, but it's understandable that you're hesitant about giving up access to your favorite sports channels.\n\nHere are some points to consider that might help you make a decision:\n\n**Pros of canceling cable and switching to streaming:**\n\n1. **Cost savings:** As you mentioned, you could save around $50 per month, which adds up to $600 per year!\n2. **Customization:** With streaming services, you can choose the channels and content you want to watch, rather than being tied to a bundling package.\n3. **Flexibility:** Streaming services often offer more flexible plans and pricing options, so you can adjust your subscription to fit your viewing habits.\n4. **No contracts:** Most streaming services are month-to-month, so you can cancel or change your plan at any time.\n\n**Cons of canceling cable and switching to streaming:**\n\n1. **Sports access:** As you mentioned, you might lose access to certain sports channels or live events, which could be a deal-breaker for sports fans.\n2. **Limited sports coverage:** Even if you find a streaming service that offers sports channels, the selection might be limited compared to traditional cable.\n3. **Internet requirements:** Streaming requires a stable and fast internet connection, which might not be available in all areas or might incur additional costs.\n\n**Sports streaming options:**\n\n1. **Sports-specific streaming services:** Services like NFL Sunday Ticket, MLB.TV, or NBA League Pass offer live sports coverage, but might not replace the full range of sports channels you get with cable.\n2. **Streaming services with sports channels:** Services like Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, or Sling TV offer a range of sports channels, including ESPN, FOX Sports, and NBC Sports. However, the selection and pricing vary between services.\n3. **Antenna and OTA streaming:** If you live in an area with good over-the-air (OTA) reception, you can use an antenna to watch local sports broadcasts for free. You can also use services like Locast or Tablo to stream OTA channels to your devices.\n\n**Ultimate advice:**\n\n1. **Assess your viewing habits:** Take an honest look at your TV viewing habits. If you mostly watch sports, news, or live events, cable might still be the best option. If you primarily watch on-demand content, streaming might be the way to go.\n2. **Explore sports streaming options:** Research the sports streaming services mentioned above and see if they offer the channels and coverage you need.\n3. **Consider a hybrid approach:** You could keep your cable subscription for sports and supplement with streaming services for on-demand content.\n4. **Monitor and adjust:** If you do decide to switch to streaming, keep an eye on the services and their offerings. If you find that you're not getting the sports coverage you need, you can always adjust your plan or explore other options.\n\nI hope this helps you weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision!"

Here are some examples of BERT's applications in industry settings, particularly in chatbots and virtual assistants:\n\n**Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:**\n\n1. **Conversational Understanding:** BERT has improved the conversational understanding capabilities of chatbots and virtual assistants. By fine-tuning BERT on specific datasets, these systems can better comprehend user queries, intent, and context, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.\n2. **Intent Detection:** BERT-based models can accurately detect user intent, allowing chatbots to route users to the correct department or provide relevant solutions. For example, a customer support chatbot can identify the intent behind a user's message, such as \"I want to return a product,\" and respond accordingly.\n3. **Entity Recognition:** BERT's entity recognition capabilities help chatbots extract specific information from user input, such as names, dates, and locations. This enables more personalized and relevant responses.\n4. **Response Generation:** BERT can be used to generate more coherent and natural-sounding responses in chatbots. By fine-tuning BERT on a specific domain or style, chatbots can produce responses that are more engaging and human-like.\n\n**Industry Applications:**\n\n1. **Customer Service:** Companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google are using BERT-based chatbots to improve customer service interactions. For example, IBM's Watson Assistant uses BERT to understand customer queries and provide personalized responses.\n2. **Healthcare:** BERT is being used in healthcare chatbots to help patients with symptom checking, medication management, and appointment scheduling. For instance, Medibio's AI-powered chatbot uses BERT to provide personalized health advice.\n3. **E-commerce:** E-commerce companies like Amazon are leveraging BERT to improve their customer service chatbots. BERT helps these chatbots understand customer queries, provide product recommendations, and assist with order tracking.\n4. **Financial Services:** BERT is being used in financial services to improve chatbot interactions for tasks like account management, transaction tracking, and investment advice. For example, Capital One's Eno chatbot uses BERT to provide personalized financial advice.\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n1. **Google Duplex:** Google's Duplex AI system uses BERT to generate natural-sounding responses for tasks like booking appointments and making reservations.\n2. **Microsoft Zo:** Microsoft's Zo chatbot uses BERT to understand user queries and respond accordingly, providing a more conversational experience.\n3. **Amazon Alexa:** Amazon has integrated BERT into Alexa's conversational AI, enabling the virtual assistant to better understand user requests and provide more accurate responses.\n\n**Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\n1. **Domain Adaptation:** BERT models may not perform well in domains with limited data or unique terminology. Fine-tuning BERT on specific datasets can help, but more research is needed to improve domain adaptation.\n2. **Explainability:** As BERT-based models become more widespread, there is a growing need to explain their decision-making processes. Researchers are working on developing techniques to provide more transparent and interpretable AI systems.\n3. **Multimodal Interactions:** The next step for BERT-based chatbots is to integrate multimodal interactions, such as voice, text, and vision. This will enable more natural and human-like interactions between users and AI systems.\n\nBERT's impact on the industry is undeniable, and its applications continue to expand. As research advances, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and human-like interactions between humans and AI systems.",

This step is crucial to ensure consistency between the pre-trained model and your dataset.\n4. **Convert to BERT Input Format:** Convert your tokenized dataset into the BERT input format, which includes:\n\t* Input IDs: Token IDs from the tokenizer.\n\t* Attention Masks: Binary masks indicating which tokens should be processed (1) or ignored (0).\n\t* Token Type IDs: IDs indicating whether a token belongs to the first sentence (0) or the second sentence (1) in a pair.\n\t* Labels: Sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) for each sample.\n5. **Fine-tune BERT:** Feed your dataset into a BERT-based model, and fine-tune the model using a suitable optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., cross-entropy). You can use libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers or PyTorch to simplify the process.\n6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. This may include adjusting the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and dropout rate.\n\n**Datasets for Sentiment Analysis:**\n\n1. **IMDB:** A popular dataset for sentiment analysis, consisting of 50,000 movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative).\n2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2):** A dataset of 10,000 movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative).\n3. **Amazon Product Reviews:** A large dataset of product reviews with sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).\n4. **Yelp Dataset:** A dataset of Yelp reviews with sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).\n5. **Customer Feedback Datasets:** You can also collect and annotate your own customer feedback dataset, which can be specific to your industry or product.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n1. **Domain Adaptation:** If your dataset is from a specific domain (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare), consider fine-tuning a domain-specific BERT model or using transfer learning to adapt the model to your domain.\n2. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Instead of analyzing sentiment at the document level, you can use BERT for aspect-based sentiment analysis, where you identify sentiment towards specific aspects or features of a product or service.\n3. **Multitask Learning:** You can also use BERT for multitask learning, where you jointly train the model on multiple sentiment analysis tasks (e.g., sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and intent detection).\n4. **Ensemble Methods:** Experiment with ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine the predictions of multiple BERT models and improve overall performance.\n\nBy following these steps and using suitable datasets, you can fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis and achieve state-of-the-art results in your customer feedback analysis tasks.",

        "content": "Food banks and pantries strive to provide nutritious food to their clients, but the quality and nutritional value of the food can vary. While there are no universal standards, many food banks and pantries follow guidelines to ensure they distribute healthy and nutritious food. Here are some insights:\n\n1. **USDA Guidelines**: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides guidance on food donations and distribution through its Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The USDA's \"Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations\" and \"The Emergency Food Assistance Program\" offer resources and guidance on nutritious food distribution.\n2. **Feeding America's Guidelines**: Feeding America, a national network of food banks, has established guidelines for its member food banks. They recommend that at least 50% of the food distributed should be from the following categories:\n\t* Fresh produce (fruits and vegetables)\n\t* Proteins (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based alternatives)\n\t* Whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat bread, quinoa, etc.)\n\t* Low-fat dairy products\n\t* Lean protein sources (beans, lentils, and nuts)\n3. **Healthy Food Bank Initiative**: The Healthy Food Bank Initiative, a collaborative effort between the National Association of Food Banks and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, aims to increase the availability of healthy food in food banks. They provide resources and guidance on sourcing, storing, and distributing nutritious food.\n4. **Food Bank Nutrition Standards**: Some food banks have developed their own nutrition standards, such as the \"Food Bank Nutrition Standards\" created by the Food Bank for New York City. These standards prioritize whole, unprocessed foods, and limit or avoid foods high in added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats.\n5. **Partnerships with Nutrition Experts**: Many food banks partner with registered dietitians, nutritionists, and other health professionals to ensure the food they distribute meets nutritional standards. These experts may help with food selection, menu planning, and nutrition education.\n6. **Food Rescue and Gleaning**: Food banks often rescue surplus food from grocery stores, farmers' markets, and food manufacturers. This rescued food can be highly nutritious, as it includes fresh produce, meat, dairy, and other perishable items that would otherwise go to waste.\n7. **Nutrition Education**: Food banks often provide nutrition education and cooking classes to help clients make the most of the food they receive. This education focuses on healthy meal planning, food safety, and cooking techniques.\n\nWhile these guidelines and standards are in place, challenges persist. Food banks often face limitations in their ability to source and distribute highly nutritious food due to factors like:\n\n* Limited funding and resources\n* Food donations that may be high in processed or unhealthy items\n* Storage and transportation limitations for perishable items\n* Client preferences and cultural or dietary restrictions\n\nDespite these challenges, food banks and pantries continue to work towards providing nutritious food to those in need.

        "content": "What a wonderful combination! Blending organic and natural forms with botanical inspiration can result in a truly unique and captivating piece. Achieving a realistic leaf or branch design on a ceramic vase requires some technique and attention to detail, but with these tips, you'll be well on your way:\n\n**Leaf Design Tips:**\n\n1. **Study Real Leaves**: Observe the shape, size, texture, and color of different leaves. Take note of the veins, edges, and how they curl or bend.\n2. **Use Reference Images**: Collect images of leaves from various angles and lighting conditions to understand their structure and how they interact with light.\n3. **Create a Leaf Template**: Draw or print a leaf shape on paper or cardstock to use as a guide. You can also create a stencil or use a leaf-shaped cookie cutter to get the desired shape.\n4. **Texture and Veining**: Use various tools to create texture and veining on your leaf design. Try using:\n\t* A toothpick or skewer to create fine veins.\n\t* A modeling tool or stylus to create more prominent veins or leaf edges.\n\t* A texture mat or stamp to add texture to the leaf surface.\n5. **Leaf Edges**: Use a needle tool or a sharp modeling tool to create a realistic leaf edge. You can also use a wire cutter or a metal rib to create a more defined edge.\n6. **Color and Glaze**: Research the colors and glazes that will achieve the desired effect. Consider using multiple glaze layers to achieve a sense of depth and dimension.\n\n**Branch Design Tips:**\n\n1. **Study Branch Structures**: Observe how branches grow, twist, and curve. Note the texture, color, and pattern of the bark.\n2. **Use Wax or Slip Trailing**: Use wax or slip trailing to create a more realistic branch texture. Apply wax or slip to the ceramic surface and then use a tool to create the desired pattern.\n3. **Layering and Building**: Build up layers of clay or slip to create a more dimensional branch structure. Use a combination of pinching, pulling, and shaping to achieve the desired form.\n4. **Twisting and Curling**: Use a combination of twisting and curling to create a more organic, natural branch shape. You can use a wire armature to support the branch as you shape it.\n5. **Bark Texture**: Use a texture mat or stamp to create a bark-like texture on the branch surface. You can also use a modeling tool to create more defined ridges or patterns.\n6. **Integration with Leaves**: Consider how the branch will interact with the leaves. You can attach leaves to the branch using slip or a small amount of clay.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment and Practice**: Don't be afraid to try new techniques and experiment with different tools and materials.\n2. **Keep it Imperfect**: Nature is imperfect, so don't strive for perfection. Embrace the imperfections and quirks that make your piece unique.\n3. **Pay Attention to Scale**: Ensure that the leaf or branch design is proportional to the vase size and shape.\n4. **Consider the Overall Form**: Think about how the leaf or branch design will interact with the overall form of the vase. Balance and harmony are key to a successful piece.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a stunning, realistic leaf or branch design on your ceramic vase. Good luck, and have fun!"

Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Working in Small Increments:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Consistency: Working on your project regularly, even if it's just for a short period, can help you stay focused and maintain momentum.\n* Fresh Perspective: Taking breaks and coming back to your project can help you approach it with a fresh perspective, which can be beneficial for problem-solving and creativity.\n* Manageable Chunks: Breaking your project into smaller tasks can make it feel less overwhelming and more manageable.\n\nCons:\n\n* Lack of Immersion: Working in short increments might not allow you to fully immerse yourself in the project, which can limit your creative flow.\n* Inconsistent Progress: If you're only working on your project for short periods, you might not see significant progress, which can be demotivating.\n\n**Dedicating a Full Day:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Immersion: Having a full day to focus on your project can help you fully immerse yourself in the creative process, allowing you to tap into your flow state and make significant progress.\n* Uninterrupted Time: A full day without distractions can help you stay focused and avoid context switching, which can increase productivity.\n* Significant Progress: You're more likely to see significant progress and accomplishments, which can be motivating and fulfilling.\n\nCons:\n\n* Burnout: Working on a project for an entire day can be exhausting, leading to burnout and decreased motivation.\n* Pressure and Stress: Having a full day to work on your project can create pressure and stress, which can negatively impact your creative process.\n\nConsidering your schedule, you might want to experiment with a combination of both approaches. Here's a possible plan:\n\n* Allocate specific days for focused work on your project (e.g., Wednesdays or Fridays).\n* Break your project into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones.\n* Set a timer for 2-3 hours on those focused days to work on your project without distractions.\n* Take regular breaks to rest your hands, stretch, and recharge.\n* Use your other days (e.g., Mondays, Saturdays, or Sundays) for shorter, 30-minute to 1-hour sessions to review your progress, plan your next steps, or work on smaller tasks.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a balance that works for you and your creative process. Experiment with different approaches, and adjust your schedule as needed to ensure you're making progress and staying motivated."

The female characters are portrayed as feminine and emotional while the male characters are portrayed as protectors and sometimes authoritative figures. The main character, Usagi, is initially portrayed as a clumsy, emotional, and weak girl but through her journey as Sailor Moon, she learns to become strong and confident. However, even as a powerful warrior, she maintains a feminine appearance and personality.\n\nOn the other hand, Magic Knight Rayearth subverts traditional gender roles. The three female protagonists, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, are strong and independent characters, each with unique personalities and strengths. They are not portrayed as being weak or in need of protection from male characters. The male characters in the series are often portrayed as more emotional and sensitive, with the male love interest being a gentle and supportive figure rather than a dominant one.\n\nOverall, the portrayal of gender roles in Magic Knight Rayearth challenges traditional gender norms, while Sailor Moon reinforces them to some extent."

They use their art to explore complex topics and push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in society. By presenting characters who challenge traditional gender roles, anime can raise awareness and promote a more inclusive and accepting society. \n\nWe're seeing more characters in anime who don't fit neatly into gendered boxes, and this can help to normalize and validate a wider range of gender identities and expressions.

Consider her dietary restrictions and preferences, though.\n4. **Pampering gift basket**: Create a basket with items like luxurious bath bombs, scented soaps, face masks, or a good book to help her unwind and relax.\n5. **Practical help**: Offer to help with errands, grocery shopping, or dog walking (if she has a pet). Sometimes, practical assistance can be the most comforting gift of all.\n6. **Flower or plant arrangement**: A beautiful bouquet or a low-maintenance plant like a succulent can brighten up her space and lift her spirits.\n7. **Magazine or book subscription**: A subscription to a magazine or a new book can provide entertainment and mental stimulation during her recovery.\n8. **Personal care items**: A set of comfortable, cozy pajamas, a soft eye mask, or a set of scented lotions can be very practical and comforting.\n9. **Meal delivery**: Consider gifting her a meal delivery service or a gift card to her favorite restaurant, so she can enjoy a break from cooking.\n10. **Get well card**: A heartfelt, handwritten card expressing your well-wishes and support can mean a lot to your neighbor during her recovery.\n\nRemember to consider your neighbor's personal preferences, allergies, and recovery needs when choosing a gift. A thoughtful and caring gesture can go a long way in helping her feel more comfortable and supported during her recovery."

Ziolkowski, a Polish-American artist, was approached by Standing Bear to create a monument that would honor the Native American leader and showcase the rich history and culture of Native Americans. After Ziolkowski's death in 1982, his wife Ruth and their children took over the project, which is still ongoing.\n\n**The Sculpture**\n\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is enormous, measuring 641 feet long and 563 feet wide. The sculpture depicts Crazy Horse riding a horse and pointing to the sacred Black Hills. The memorial is carved into a granite mountain, and the sculpture is being built without any government funding, relying solely on private donations and visitor fees.\n\n**Visitor Information**\n\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is open year-round, except for December 25.

You can also add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors.\n* Experiment with different spices, herbs, and fruits to create unique flavor profiles. For example, you can add a cinnamon stick to your Cucumber-Lime Syrup for a warm, spicy flavor.\n* Consider making a \"mother\" syrup or bitters that you can then flavor and dilute to create different variations.
