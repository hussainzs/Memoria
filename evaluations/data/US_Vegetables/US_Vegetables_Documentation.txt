- Geographic description ‘World’ represents total U.S. import or export data for the specific month/year/market segment/commodity/commodity detail/measurement unit. The dataset also contains country-level data. 
- Data do not include vegetable seed for planting or mushroom spawn. Data do include potato seed and onion sets.
- Marketing years often begin in one calendar year and end in the next—for example, 2023/24 refers to the marketing year beginning in 2023 and ending in 2024 (example is August-July). Beginning and ending months differ by crop and in some cases, by product segment within a commodity. Commodities with a marketing year that start in January and end in December are identified in the marketing year column as a calendar year.
