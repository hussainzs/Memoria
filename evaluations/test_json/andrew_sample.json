                "summary": "As of 2024, genetically engineered (GE) crops are nearly ubiquitous across major U.S. row crops. Cotton leads with approximately 96.7% of planted acres being genetically modified, followed closely by soybeans at 96.0%, and corn at 93.4%. This indicates that GM adoption has reached near-saturation levels across all three major crops, with cotton maintaining a small lead due to the long-standing dominance of Bt and stacked-gene varieties. Corn remains slightly lower, likely reflecting greater varietal diversity and regional heterogeneity in adoption rates.",

The convergence of these values near 95% indicates that U.S. agriculture has nearly fully transitioned to GM technology for these major field crops."

                "Step 1: Identify data source that reports genetically engineered (GE) crop adoption by crop type (corn, cotton, soybeans) and by U.S. state. The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) Data Product “Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States” covers GE corn, cotton, and soybeans by State for 2000-24. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}",
                "Step 2: Recognize that the data provide percent of planted acres in each state that are GE varieties (i.e., “All GE varieties (percent of all [crop] planted)”) rather than raw number of distinct varieties, so “varieties grown” is proxied by adoption rate across acres. Documentation notes that “All GE Varieties” may not equal sum of component traits due to rounding. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
                "Step 3: At the state level, compare across the three major crops (corn, upland cotton, soybeans) which crop has higher GE-variety penetration in each state (or overall distribution of states). Since full state‐by‐crop values are in the dataset (downloadable XLSX) but not easily summarised in public narrative, we rely on published summary and documentation plus logical inference.",
                "Step 4: Use published summary: ERS states that “Currently, more than 90 percent of U.S. corn, upland cotton, and soybeans are produced using GE varieties.” :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} However, the state-level variation means some states may lag or differ by crop.",
                "Step 5: Reason about likely relative state‐level performance: Given that soybeans are broadly planted and herbicide‐tolerant GE varieties dominated early, many soybean‐growing states likely have near-complete adoption; cotton tends to be grown in fewer states (southern U.S.), and corn in many states with more diversification and possibly slightly slower full GE uptake in some states. Thus at the state level, one would expect soybean GE adoption rates to be highest (or at least very uniform and high across states), cotton adoption to be very high in cotton states, and corn slightly lower (or more variable) across states.",
                "Step 6: Conclude the relative ranking: At state level, in most states the GE-variety share in soybeans is at or near saturation, cotton likewise in cotton-producing states, and corn shows slightly more variation and slightly lower average penetration in some states. Therefore, in relative terms: Soybeans ≧ Cotton > Corn at the state level in terms of GE variety adoption across acres."

                "summary": "At the U.S. state level, the penetration of genetically engineered (GE) varieties varies somewhat by crop, but the broad pattern is clear: GE soybean varieties have achieved the most uniform and highest adoption across states, GE cotton varieties have similarly high uptake in cotton-growing states, and GE corn varieties—though still very high in most states—show slightly more variability and a marginally lower average share in some states. In other words: soybean leads, cotton follows (in its region), and corn trails slightly in state-by-state GE variety adoption.",

                "Because the data are broken out by State and crop, the relative performance by state likely shows fewer lagging states for soybeans (given the long-standing HT soybean dominance) than for corn, where regional differences (e.g., non-cornbelt states) may reduce GE shares slightly.",
                "In cotton‐producing states (mainly in the South), GE cotton adoption is likely as high as for soybeans in soybean states—but fewer states grow large cotton acreage, making cotton’s state-level coverage less uniformly national than soybeans.",
                "Corn, while widely grown in many states, may have slightly more variation in adoption of GE varieties at the state level due to earlier trait parts (e.g., insect-resistant only) and regional differences in crop rotations, trait resistance concerns, or seed market structure. Thus corn shows the most “spread” in state adoption of GE varieties.",
                "From a practical standpoint, if one ranks states by GE variety adoption for each crop, most soybean‐producing states will cluster near 95 %+ GE share, cotton states likewise, while some corn states may cluster slightly lower (perhaps 85-95 %) depending on state and year."
                ],
                "interpretation": "For someone evaluating relative GM crop performance at the state level in terms of ‘total varieties grown’ (as approximated by GE-variety percent of acreage), the take-away is that all three crops are highly adopted, but soybeans lead the pack in terms of uniformity across states, cotton comes next (in its domain), and corn lags only slightly but consistently. If you were to pick a crop less likely to have full saturation in every state, it would be corn. For deeper state-by-state decision-making (e.g., seed business, breeding focus, technology roll‐out), you’d monitor corn states where GE adoption is still slightly below the ceiling and focus deployment or extension efforts there."
