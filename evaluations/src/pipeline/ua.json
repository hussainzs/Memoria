    "user": "As I was reviewing our sales data on ProX yesterday evening, I noticed that its strong performance among young customers in the Southwest sub-region is also accompanied by a relatively high adoption rate of the \"Elite Support\" add-on service. Specifically, 22% of ProX buyers in the 18-24 age cohort have opted for Elite Support, compared to only 12% of those in the 35-44 age cohort. Can you help me understand if there's a correlation between the perceived value of ProX and the appeal of our premium support services among young customers?",
    "agent": "To further investigate the correlation between the perceived value of ProX and the appeal of our premium support services among young customers, I recommend analyzing the sales distribution of Elite Support specifically for ProX buyers in the Southwest sub-region, focusing on the 18-24 age cohort. \n\nLet's categorize these customers into two sub-groups: those who purchased ProX with Elite Support (i.e., \"ProX + Elite\") and those who purchased ProX without Elite Support. We can then compare the sales distribution of ProX + Elite versus ProX alone within this 18-24 age cohort, examining metrics such as average order value, purchase frequency, and customer retention rates.\n\nAdditionally, I propose reviewing any available feedback or surveys from customers who opted for ProX + Elite to identify common themes or reasons why they chose this combination. This can provide valuable insights into the perceived value of our premium support services among young customers in the Southwest sub-region.",
